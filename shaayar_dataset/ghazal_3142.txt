dil hi to hai na sang-o-khisht dard se bhar na aae kyuun
it's just a heart, no stony shard; why shouldn't it fill with pain

roenge ham hazar baar koi hamen satae kyuun
i will cry a thousand times,why should someone complain

dair nahin haram nahin dar nahin astan nahin
neither door nor threshold 'tis, no temple 'tis nor mosque

baiThe hain rahguzar pe ham ghair hamen uThae kyuun
why should rivals bid me leave the street's public domain

when she has a lustrous face, as bright as the sun at noon
aap hi ho nazara-soz parde men munh chhupae kyuun

a burning spectacle is she, why veiled does she remain
dagger-like glances, arrow-like airs, fatal well could be

tera hi aks-e-rukh sahi samne tere aae kyuun
thus even from facing you, your image should refrain

qaid-e-hayat o band-e-gham asl men donon ek hain
prison of life and sorrow's chains in truth are just the same

maut se pahle aadmi gham se najat paae kyuun
then relief from pain, ere death,why should man

husn aur us pe husn-e-zan rah gai bul-havas ki sharm
beauty and its self-esteem did spare my rival shame

apne pe e'timad hai ghair ko azmae kyuun
when she is self-confident, in testing him what gain

vaan vo ghurur-e-izz-o-naz yaan ye hijab-e-pas-e-vaza'
she won't call me to her house, by the wayside I can't meet

raah men ham milen kahan bazm men vo bulae kyuun
she is proud of name and grace, and I by form refrain

haan vo nahin khuda-parast jaao vo bevafa sahi
let her a non-believer be, unfaithful too, and therefore

jis ko ho diin o dil aziiz us ki gali men jaae kyuun
if you value faith and heart, then from her street abstain

'ghalib'-e-khasta ke baghair kaun se kaam band hain
In poor Ghalib's absence say, what tasks are stopped today

roiye zaar zaar kya kijiye haae haae kyuun
then why shed such copious tears, why lament in vain
