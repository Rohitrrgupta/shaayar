hamare aage tira jab kisu ne naam liya
In my presence when there was mention of you

dil-e-sitam-zada ko ham ne thaam thaam liya
qasam jo khaiye to tala-e-zulekha ki

if one swears, should be upon Zulekha's fate
aziz-e-misr ka bhi sahab ik ghulam liya

her slave was superior to the head of state
kharab rahte the masjid ke aage mai-khane

ruined once,compared with mosques,had taverns been
nigah-e-mast ne saaqi ki intiqam liya

then Saaqi's heady eyes avenged, reversed the scene
vo kaj-ravish na mila raste men mujh se kabhi

in the street, the crooked one, evaded me
na sidhi tarah se un ne mira salam liya

nor to greetings did respond, straightforwardly
maza dikhavenge be-rahmi ka tiri sayyad

captor, your heartlessness I will make you regret
gar iztirab-e-asiri ne zer-e-dam liya

when zest for being ensnared traps me in your net
mire saliqe se meri nibhi mohabbat men

in my own way I have dealt with love you see
tamam umr main nakamiyon se kaam liya

all my life I made my failures work for me
agarche gosha-guzin huun main shairon men 'mir'

in a corner, Miir, although 'mongst poets I be
pa mere shor ne ru-e-zamin tamam liya

yet my voice does eclipse the earth entirely
