main khayal huun kisi aur ka mujhe sochta koi aur hai
I am someone else's thought, someone else brings me to mind

sar-e-aina mira aks hai pas-e-aina koi aur hai
my image in the mirror wrought, someone else is there behind

main kisi ke dast-e-talab men huun to kisi ke harf-e-dua men huun
I am in someone's outstretched hand, and in someone's prayer prayer I be

main nasib huun kisi aur ka mujhe mangta koi aur hai
I am someone's destiny but someone else does ask for me

ajab e'tibar o be-e'tibari ke darmiyan hai zindagi
strange that hanging tween belief and disbelief my life should be

main qarib huun kisi aur ke mujhe janta koi aur hai
I am close to someone else, and someone else here fathoms me

miri raushni tire khadd-o-khal se mukhtalif to nahin magar
tho my sight unconversant with your features may not be

tu qarib aa tujhe dekh luun tu vahi hai ya koi aur hai
if or not you are the same come close and let me see,

tujhe dushmanon ki khabar na thi mujhe doston ka pata nahin
tiri dastan koi aur thi mira vaqia koi aur hai

vahi munsifon ki rivayaten vahi faislon ki ibaraten
the same traditions of the law, the same judicial pronouncement

mira jurm to koi aur tha pa miri saza koi aur hai
my crime was something else but then something else my punishment

kabhi lauT aaen to puchhna nahin dekhna unhen ghaur se
on their return merely observe them carefully question them not

jinhen raste men khabar hui ki ye rasta koi aur hai
who halfway in the journey found these roads were not the ones they sought

jo miri riyazat-e-nim-shab ko 'salim' subh na mil saki
if for my midnight prayers, Saliim, a dawn there shall never be

to phir is ke maani to ye hue ki yahan khuda koi aur hai
then it means that in this world there is a God other than thee
