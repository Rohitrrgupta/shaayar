gul phenke hai auron ki taraf balki samar bhi
not just flowers, fruits as well, at others do you throw

ai khana-bar-andaz-e-chaman kuchh to idhar bhi
O wastrel of the garden, some, this way too bestow

kya zid hai mire saath khuda jaane vagarna
God would know, as why with me, she is so obstinate

kaafi hai tasalli ko miri ek nazar bhi
or else, for my contentment, just a glance is adequate

ai abr qasam hai tujhe rone ki hamare
O nimbus cloud do swear upon / my tears and my sighs

tujh chashm se Tapka hai kabhu lakht-e-jigar bhi
have pieces of a broken heart / dripped ever from your eyes

ai naala sad afsos javan marne pe tere
O lament! your youthful death / a hundred times I grieve

paaya na tanik dekhne tiin ru-e-asar bhi
the slightest hint, of consequence, I did not receive

kis hasti-e-mauhum pe nazan hai tu ai yaar
kuchh apne shab-o-roz ki hai tuj ko khabar bhi

tanha tire matam men nahin sham-e-siyah-posh
the Night's black garb is not alone / there in your lament

rahta hai sada chaak gareban-e-sahar bhi
the ever-tattered collar of / the Dawn too is present

'sauda' tiri fariyad se ankhon men kaTi raat
'sauda', up in pleas and prayers, all night long you lie

aai hai sahar hone ko Tuk tu kahin mar bhi
dawn is round the corner, you might as well now die
