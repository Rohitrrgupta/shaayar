chahiye achchhon ko jitna chahiye
love beauties to your full relish

ye agar chahen to phir kya chahiye
if they love back what else to wish

sohbat-e-rindan se vajib hai hazar
the company of drunks eschew

ja-e-mai apne ko khincha chahiye
in bars let wine not near you

chahne ko tere kya samjha tha dil
it thought was easy loving you

baare ab is se bhi samjha chahiye
this with my heart I must pursue

chaak mat kar jaib be-ayyam-e-gul
rend not your clothes till spring is here

kuchh udhar ka bhi ishara chahiye
a signal from there should appear

dosti ka parda hai beganagi
for love, indifference is a guise

munh chhupana ham se chhoá¸Œa chahiye
stop hiding from me I'd advise

dushmani ne meri khoya ghair ko
it cost him all, my enmity

kis qadar dushman hai dekha chahiye
apni rusvai men kya chalti hai sai

in vain efforts at self-disgrace
do need a stormy sweetheart's face

munhasir marne pe ho jis ki umiid
whose hopes depend on death merely

na-umidi us ki dekha chahiye
his despondency you should see

ghafil in mah-talaton ke vaste
you seek these beauties company

chahne vaala bhi achchha chahiye
the mirror first you need to see

chahte hain khub-ruyon ko 'asad'
these moon-faced beauties, be aware

aap ki surat to dekha chahiye
seek lovers good-looking and fair
