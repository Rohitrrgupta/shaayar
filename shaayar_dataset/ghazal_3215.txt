har ek baat pe kahte ho tum ki tu kya hai
at every turn you question me, asking what are you'

tumhin kaho ki ye andaz-e-guftugu kya hai
tell me pray what manner of speech do you pursue

na shoale men ye karishma na barq men ye ada
neither flames this magic nor lightning this charm do have

koi batao ki vo shokh-e-tund-khu kya hai
who's this stormy quicksilver beauty I wish I knew

ye rashk hai ki vo hota hai ham-sukhan tum se
I am not afraid my foe will corrupt your mind somehow

I am merely jealous that he gets to talk to you
chipak raha hai badan par lahu se pairahan

my clothes are caused, by oozing blood, to cling unto my frame
hamare jaib ko ab hajat-e-rafu kya hai

what need is there now for my vest to be darned anew
jala hai jism jahan dil bhi jal gaya hoga

with my body consigned to flames, my heart too would have burnt
kuredte ho jo ab raakh justuju kya hai

why do you rake the ashes now, what is it you pursue
ragon men dauá¸Œte phirne ke ham nahin qaail

merely because it courses through the veins, I'm not convinced
jab aankh hi se na Tapka to phir lahu kya hai

if it drips not from one's eyes blood cannot be held true
vo chiiz jis ke liye ham ko ho bahisht aziiz

save for fragrant flavoured wine, what else can it be
that for which we paradise persistently pursue

piyun sharab agar khum bhi dekh luun do-char
glasses goblets jugs and pitchers all are of no use

ye shisha o qadah o kuuza o subu kya hai
even if in barrels found,

I'd gladly drink the brew
rahi na taqat-e-guftar aur agar ho bhi

no longer have I strength to speak but even if I did
to kis umiid pe kahiye ki aarzu kya hai

what hope can I rely on to narrate my wish to you
hua hai shah ka musahib phire hai itrata

becoming the the crony of the king, he preens and struts around
vagarna shahr men 'ghalib' ki aabru kya hai

or else what honour in this town to Ghalib would accrue
