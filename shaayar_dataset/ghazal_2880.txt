'momin' khuda ke vaste aisa makan na chhoḌ
for sake of God! momin from leaving this house refrain

dozakh men Daal khuld ko ku-e-butan na chhoḌ
let paradise to hell consign, leave not the idol's lane

ashiq to jante hain vo ai dil yahi sahi
that she knows you love her, O heart this much you gain

har-chand be-asar hai par aah o fughan na chhoḌ
don't give up your lamentation, though it be in vain

us tab-e-naznin ko kahan tab-e-infial
jasus mere vaste ai bad-guman na chhoḌ

na-char denge aur kisi khub-ru ko dil
some other gentle beauty will now on my heart sustain

achchha tu apni khu-e-bad ai bad-zaban na chhoḌ
your petulance, abusiveness, you're welcome to retain

zakhmi kiya udu ko to marna muhal hai
if you wound my rival, dying will be hard then too

qurban jaun tere mujhe nim-jan na chhoḌ
don't leave me half-alive I will give my life for you,

kuchh kuchh durust zid se tiri ho chale hain vo
She seems to have improved somewhat at your insistence

yak-chand aur kaj-ravi ai asman na chhoḌ
with your wayward gait o Sky don't for a while dispense

jis kuche men guzar saba ka na ho sake
any street, access to which, zephyrs will never gain

ai andalib us ke liye gulsitan na chhoḌ
O nightingale do not forsake the garden for that lane

gar phir bhi ashk aaen to janun ki ishq hai
if even then, his eyes tear up, his love is true I'll know

huqqe ka munh se ghair ki janib dhuan na chhoḌ
smoke, into my rival's face, when you cease to blow

hota hai is jahim men hasil visal-e-jaur
you will meet the virgins here, in this fiery domain

'momin' ajab bahisht hai dair-e-mughan na chhoḌ
momin as paradise is myth, immersed in wine remain
