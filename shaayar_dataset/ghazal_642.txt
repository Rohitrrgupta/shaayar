nukta-chin hai gham-e-dil us ko sunae na bane
I cannot pour my heart to her, for she does criticize

kya bane baat jahan baat banae na bane
How can I get my goal when I, cant even verbalize

main bulata to huun us ko magar ai jazba-e-dil
I do call out to her, my feelings, but what can I say

us pe ban jaae kuchh aisi ki bin aae na bane
Something happens and she cant help but stay away

khel samjha hai kahin chhoḌ na de bhuul na jaae
She should not forsake forget me ,for it is no play

kaash yuun bhi ho ki bin mere satae na bane
Without my teasing, if only, she found it hard to stay

ghair phirta hai liye yuun tire khat ko ki agar
My rival roams, your message tucked so by his side

koi puchhe ki ye kya hai to chhupae na bane
If someone were to ask what's this, he's unable to hide

is nazakat ka bura ho vo bhale hain to kya
Her daintiness be damned, tho noble, she may be as much

haath aaven to unhen haath lagae na bane
E'en when I manage to get hold,

kah sake kaun ki ye jalvagari kis ki hai
Who can fathom who it is behind the veil concealed

parda chhoḌa hai vo us ne ki uThae na bane
Its been dropped in such a way it cannot be unveiled

maut ki raah na dekhun ki bin aae na rahe
I do not wait for death for it will surely accrue

tum ko chahun ki na aao to bulae na bane
If I wish that you don't come, I can't call out to you

bojh vo sar se gira hai ki uThae na uThe
The burden that's fallen on my head I cannot unseat

kaam vo aan paḌa hai ki banae na bane
A task has now befallen me that I cannot complete

ishq par zor nahin hai ye vo atish 'ghalib'
Love is not in one's control, this is that fire roused

ki lagae na lage aur bujhae na bane
It cannot be willed to ignite, nor can it be doused
