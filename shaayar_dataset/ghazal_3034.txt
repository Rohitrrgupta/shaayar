divangi se dosh pe zunnar bhi nahin
in frenzy, on my shoulder, there's not even a thread

yaani hamare jeb men ik taar bhi nahin
sign of my idol worship, has vanished now I dread

dil ko niyaz-e-hasrat-e-didar kar chuke
for a glimpse I sacrificed, my heart to this degree

dekha to ham men taqat-e-didar bhi nahin
that when I looked I found I had not the strength to see

milna tira agar nahin asan to sahl hai
had meeting you, been just hard, would be easy on me

dushvar to yahi hai ki dushvar bhi nahin
the problem is it is an impossibility

be-ishq umr kaT nahin sakti hai aur yaan
its not possible to live, a life sans love but here

strength to bear the ecstacy of pain does not appear
shoridgi ke haath se hai sar vabal-e-dosh

my head, a burden has become, in my craziness
sahra men ai khuda koi divar bhi nahin

there's not even a wall O lord in this wilderness
leave aside the scope to bear, enmity 'gainst foes

yaan dil men zoaf se havas-e-yar bhi nahin
desire for beloved's lost in my weakened throes

Dar nala-ha-e-zar se mere khuda ko maan
fear these my plaintive cries, be fearful of God's rage

after all they're not the caws of roosters in a cage
dil men hai yaar ki saf-e-mizhgan se ru-kashi

my heart is confronted with her lashes all arow
een strength to bear the prick of thorns is not there although

is sadgi pe kaun na mar jaae ai khuda
at her innocence O Lord! who would not give his life

laá¸Œte hain aur haath men talvar bhi nahin
in her hand there is no sword, yet ventures into strife

dekha 'asad' ko khalvat-o-jalvat men bar-ha
have often seen Asad alone and then publicly

divana gar nahin hai to hushyar bhi nahin
if crazy he is not then neither rational is he
