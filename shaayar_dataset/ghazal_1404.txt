shikve ke naam se be-mehr khafa hota hai
unkind, at mere mention of complaint she is annoyed

ye bhi mat kah ki jo kahiye to gila hota hai
do not even utter this as grievance is implied

pur huun main shikve se yuun raag se jaise baaja
I am so full of complaint, as instruments with air

ik zara chheá¸Œiye phir dekhiye kya hota hai
you have to but lightly blow, and then see what is there

go samajhta nahin par husn-e-talafi dekho
although she is naive yet see, how well she makes amends

shikva-e-jaur se sargarm-e-jafa hota hai
at complaints of tyranny, more cruelty attends

ishq ki raah men hai charkh-e-makaukab ki vo chaal
in love's path the star filled sky's footsteps are so effete

sust-rau jaise koi abla-pa hota hai
as of one who slowly moves with blisters on his feet

kyuun na Thahren hadaf-e-navak-e-bedad ki ham
target of cruelty's missiles why should I not be

aap uTha laate hain gar tiir khata hota hai
Myself I gather and return arrows that miss me

khuub tha pahle se hote jo ham apne bad-khvah
had I wished ill on myself would be of greater use

ki bhala chahte hain aur bura hota hai
Coz when now I hope for good, calamity accrues

naala jaata tha pare arsh se mera aur ab
my plaints went past the heavens once but it is, they now

lab tak aata hai jo aisa hi rasa hota hai
barely reach up to my lips, if successful somehow

khama mera ki vo hai bar-bud-e-bazm-e-sukhan
my quill is the bard Baarbud in gatherings of rhyme

shaah ki madh men yuun naghma-sara hota hai
just like him breaks into song praising the king sublime

Mighty King with stars for troops, whose standard is the Sun
tere ikram ka haq kis se ada hota hai

he who can repay your kindness, is there anyone
saat aqlim ka hasil jo faraham kiije

wealth of seven continents even if were to be
to vo lashkar ka tire nal-e-baha hota hai

would merely meet the ransom set by your cavalry
har mahine men jo ye badr se hota hai hilal

every month from full moon to a crescent it
astan par tire mah nasiya sa hota hai

tis because upon your doorstep supplicates it's brow
main jo gustakh huun ain-e-ghazal-khvani men

my audacity of style in Gazal-rendering
ye bhi tera hi karam zauq-faza hota hai

your kindness is the cause for this zest O mighty king
rakhiyo 'ghalib' mujhe is talkh-navai men muaaf

pardon me for bitterness that now my songs possess
aaj kuchh dard mire dil men siva hota hai

the poignancy of pain in my heart is in excess
