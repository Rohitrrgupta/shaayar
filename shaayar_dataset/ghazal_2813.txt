na hui gar mire marne se tasalli na sahi
my dying didn't render relief, it does not matter much

imtihan aur bhi baaqi ho to ye bhi na sahi
if further trials now remain, then let them be as such

no matter ardor could not reap, the rose of its delight
the thorns of sorrow still remain from thirsting for your sight

mai-parastan khum-e-mai munh se lagae hi bane
wine worshippers tis surely meet, drink from the jar today

ek din gar na hua bazm men saaqi na sahi
If saaqi's missing for a day, no cause is for dismay

As Majnuun's breath was reason for the desert's light and sheen
gar nahin sham-e-siyah-khana-e-laili na sahi

Lantern of Lailaa's darkened tent, let it not have been
ek hangame pe mauquf hai ghar ki raunaq

if just on clamor now depends, the home's hullabaloo
nauha-e-gham hi sahi naghma-e-shadi na sahi

if be not songs of joy, no loss, with sorrow's cries make do
na sataish ki tamanna na sile ki parva

I do not harbor hope for praise nor care I for compense
gar nahin hain mire ashar men maani na sahi

thus if my lines are meaningless, with them, you may dispense
be thankful for the ecstacy of beauties' company

na hui 'ghalib' agar umr-e-tabii na sahi
e'en if you died before your time, at least was joyfully
