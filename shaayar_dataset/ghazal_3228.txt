zara sa qatra kahin aaj agar ubharta hai
now ever if a trifling droplet happens to appear

samundaron hi ke lahje men baat karta hai
like the mighty oceans its head it seeks to rear

khuli chhaton ke diye kab ke bujh gae hote
the lamps on open terraces would long have been erased

koi to hai jo havaon ke par katarta hai
the might of winds someone is who manages to shear

sharafaton ki yahan koi ahmiyat hi nahin
decency has little value it does not get respect

kisi ka kuchh na bigaá¸Œo to kaun Darta hai
Until harm is caused to them people do not fear

ye dekhna hai ki sahra bhi hai samundar bhi
vo meri tishna-labi kis ke naam karta hai

tum aa gae ho to kuchh chandni si baten hon
how often does the moon condescend to come to earth

zamin pe chand kahan roz roz utarta hai
let us talk of love and joy now that you are here

zamin ki kaisi vakalat ho phir nahin chalti
however you defend the earth it is of no avail

jab asman se koi faisla utarta hai
when a judgement is imposed from the heavens clear
