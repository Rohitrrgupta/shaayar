ku-ba-ku phail gai baat shanasai ki
The news of our affinity has spread to every door

us ne khushbu ki tarah meri pazirai ki
He welcomed me like fragrance which he did adore

kaise kah duun ki mujhe chhoḌ diya hai us ne
How can I say that I have been deserted by my beau

baat to sach hai magar baat hai rusvai ki
Its true but this will cause me to be shamed for evermore

vo kahin bhi gaya lauTa to mire paas aaya
Each time he deserted me, came back to me once more

bas yahi baat hai achchhi mire harjai ki
I like this very aspect of my faithless paramour

tera pahlu tire dil ki tarah abad rahe
Just as your heart is full of love, be dear ones by your side

tujh pe guzre na qayamat shab-e-tanhai ki
May pain of long and lonely nights be never in your store

us ne jalti hui peshani pe jab haath rakha
When he gently placed his hand upon my burning brow

ruuh tak aa gai tasir masihai ki
It was as though the saviour's touch had infused my core

ab bhi barsat ki raton men badan TuTta hai
Till even now in rainy climes, my limbs are aching, sore

jaag uThti hain ajab khvahishen angḌai ki
The yen to stretch out languidly then comes to the fore
