ghair len mahfil men bose jaam ke
rivals get to sip from goblets in her company

ham rahen yuun tishna-lab paigham ke
thirsty for even a message I'm destined to be

khastagi ka tum se kya shikva ki ye
why should I complain to you for my sorry state

tis the mischief of the sky that decides my fate
khat likhenge garche matlab kuchh na ho

blank letters I will write to you, it is all the same
ham to ashiq hain tumhare naam ke

because I am a lover, dear, of your very name
raat pi zamzam pe mai aur subh-dam

night, at zam-zam I had wine, and then, come dawn
stains in my holy cloak I washed, till they all were gone

dil ko ankhon ne phansaya kya magar
your eyes ensnared this heart of mine, how can one forget

ye bhi halqe hain tumhare daam ke
these eyes of yours too are the strands of your beauty's net

shaah ke hai ghusl-e-sehhat ki khabar
news of the king's restorative bath is in the air

dekhiye kab din phiren hammam ke
let's see when the fortunes of the bath-house now repair

ishq ne 'ghalib' nikamma kar diya
Ghalib, a worthless person, this love has made of me

varna ham bhi aadmi the kaam ke
otherwise a man of substance I once used to be
