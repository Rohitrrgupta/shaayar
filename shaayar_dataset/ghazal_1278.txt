zakhm par chhiḌken kahan tiflan-e-be-parva namak
where, salt upon my wounds do these careless children strew

kya maza hota agar patthar men bhi hota namak
what relish would result if salt did their stones imbue

dust of her path, in wounds of my heart, does pride induce
varna hota hai jahan men kis qadar paida namak

for else, salt, to this extent, where could the world produce
mujh ko arzani rahe tujh ko mubarak hojiyo

may I be blessed with pain of the nightingale's lament
nala-e-bulbul ka dard aur khanda-e-gul ka namak

may you be graced by the flower's laughter's salt content
shor-e-jaulan tha kanar-e-bahr par kis ka ki aaj

on ocean's edge, whose, galloping, steed raised this clamour
like salt rubbed on ocean's wound, seems the sand on shore

daad deta hai mire zakhm-e-jigar ki vaah vaah
my liver's wounds she praises I'm glad to this degree

yaad karta hai mujhe dekhe hai vo jis ja namak
wherever she then salt espies, she does think of me

chhoḌ kar jaana tan-e-majruh-e-ashiq haif hai
to leave a lover's battered frame pity is indeed!

dil talab karta hai zakhm aur mange hain aaza namak
his heart desires wounds and salt, body parts do need

ghair ki minnat na khinchunga pai-e-taufir-e-dard
To exacerbate my pain, to rivals I won't go

zakhm misl-e-khanda-e-qatil hai sar-ta-pa namak
my wounds, like my killers laugh, are salt from head to toe

yaad hain 'ghalib' tujhe vo din ki vajd-e-zauq men
can those days be then recalled when in desire's spell

zakhm se girta to main palkon se chunta tha namak
with my lashes I would sift if from my wounds salt fell

is amal men aish ki lazzat nahin milti 'asad'
zor nisbat mai se rakhta hai azara ka namak
