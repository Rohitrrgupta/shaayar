ab ke ham bichhḌe to shayad kabhi khvabon men milen
should we now be parted, in dreams we might be found

jis tarah sukhe hue phuul kitabon men milen
like dried flowers found in books, fragile, fraying browned

DhunDh ujḌe hue logon men vafa ke moti
seek ye pearls of faithfulness in those lost and drowned

ye khazane tujhe mumkin hai kharabon men milen
it well could be these

treasures in wastelands do abound
gham-e-duniya bhi gham-e-yar men shamil kar lo

let love's longing with the ache of existence compound
nashsha baḌhta hai sharaben jo sharabon men milen

when spirits intermingle the euphoria is profound
tu khuda hai na mira ishq farishton jaisa

neither are not god nor is my love divine, profound
donon insan hain to kyuun itne hijabon men milen

if human both then why does this secrecy surround
aaj ham daar pe khinche gae jin baton par

the acts for which today I've been crucified around
kya ajab kal vo zamane ko nisabon men milen

if prescribed tomorrow, then why should it astound
ab na vo main na vo tu hai na vo maazi hai 'faraz'

i am not the same, nor you, our past's no more around
jaise do shakhs tamanna ke sarabon men milen

like two shadows in the mists of longing to be found
