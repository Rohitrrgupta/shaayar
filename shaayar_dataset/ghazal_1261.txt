kab vo sunta hai kahani meri
when does she ever heed my state

aur phir vo bhi zabani meri
and that too then when I narrate

of murderous glance ask not the pain
see tears of blood that my eyes rain

kya bayan kar ke mira roenge yaar
what else will friends relate, bemoan

but for my verses' distressed tone
I roam in thought's deserts alone

bhuul jaana hai nishani meri
by my forgetfulness I'm known

my rival sits now face to face
ruk gaya dekh ravani meri

he's flummoxed by my wit and grace
me as a roadside rock they view

sakht arzan hai girani meri
real low priced is my high value

whirlwind in paths of discontent
I'm wrought by gale of love's foment

dahan us ka jo na malum hua
her mouth, to me, could not be known

khul gai hech madani meri
my ignorance to all I've shown

kar diya zoaf ne aajiz 'ghalib'
me, feebleness does so debase

for dotage, my youth's a disgrace
