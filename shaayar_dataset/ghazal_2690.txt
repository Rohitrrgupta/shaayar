jaur se baaz aae par baaz aaen kya
she, even though contrite, torture cannot eschew

kahte hain ham tujh ko munh dikhlaen kya
says I'm ashamed, I can't, now show my face to you

raat din gardish men hain saat asman
night and day the seven skies do perambulate

ho rahega kuchh na kuchh ghabraen kya
why should I as something's surely in my fate

laag ho to us ko ham samjhen lagao
enmity, as affection I would have perceived

jab na ho kuchh bhi to dhoka khaen kya
when she feels nothing why, should I be self-deceived

ho liye kyuun nama-bar ke saath saath
I now seek to go along with the messenger

ya rab apne khat ko ham pahunchaen kya
O Lord! should I carry my own letter to her

mauj-e-khun sar se guzar hi kyuun na jaae
what if the waves of blood now do wash over me

astan-e-yar se uTh jaaen kya
for this should I arise and leave her company

umr bhar dekha kiya marne ki raah
all my life, for death's advent, I did surely wait

mar gae par dekhiye dikhlaen kya
now that I am dead lets see what I demonstrate

puchhte hain vo ki 'ghalib' kaun hai
she asks of everyone who is this Gaalib say

koi batlao ki ham batlaen kya
someone should tell me now what I should I tell her pray
