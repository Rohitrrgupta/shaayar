rahiye ab aisi jagah chal kar jahan koi na ho
To go and live in such a place where no one else should be

ham-sukhan koi na ho aur ham-zaban koi na ho
No one there to share one's thoughts no soul for company

be-dar-o-divar sa ik ghar banaya chahiye
One should build an open house, no walls nor doors to see

koi ham-saya na ho aur pasban koi na ho
No neighbours to surround nor guards for security

paá¸Œiye gar bimar to koi na ho timardar
If perchance one were to ail no one to remedy

aur agar mar jaiye to nauha-khvan koi na ho
And if one were to die no one to weep for thee
