ye ham jo hijr men divar-o-dar ko dekhte hain
Separation makes me glance, at these my walls and

kabhi saba ko kabhi nama-bar ko dekhte hain
at times for the breeze, at times, for messenger I wait

vo aae ghar men hamare khuda ki qudrat hai
that she has come to my home, is God's divinity

kabhi ham un ko kabhi apne ghar ko dekhte hain
At times I look at her face, at times my home I see

nazar lage na kahin us ke dast-o-bazu ko
the evil eye should'nt befall, her hands and arms I pray

ye log kyuun mire zakhm-e-jigar ko dekhte hain
why, at the wounds of my heart, do people stare today

tire javahir-e-turf-e-kulah ko kya dekhen
what do I see these jewels, encrusted on your head

ham auj-e-tala-e-lal-o-gohar ko dekhte hain
fate of these pearls and rubies, I regard instead
