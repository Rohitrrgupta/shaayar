muddat hui hai yaar ko mehman kiye hue
Its been long, since my lover, was a guest of mine

josh-e-qadah se bazm charaghan kiye hue
and my house was suffused with the glow of wine

karta huun jama phir jigar-e-lakht-lakht ko
I again amass the shards of my heart somehow

arsa hua hai davat-e-mizhgan kiye hue
Ages since I've feasted on her eyelashes now

phir vaz'-e-ehtiyat se rukne laga hai dam
The demands of decorum cause me great torment

barson hue hain chaak gareban kiye hue
Long past since my collar, in my craziness I rent

Lament longs that from my breath may sparks of fire flow
muddat hui hai sair-e-charaghan kiye hue

lts been a while since on a journey, of lights I did go
phir pursish-e-jarahat-e-dil ko chala hai ishq

Love proceeds to console my wounded heart again
While carrying with it quantities of salt for to rub in

phir bhar raha huun khama-e-mizhgan ba-khun-e-dil
The quill of my eyelashes I, dip in my blood anew

For to decorate my vest in the flower's form and
baham-digar hue hain dil o diida phir raqib

My heart and my eyes are now adversaries again
nazzara o khayal ka saman kiye hue

One seeks to think of her, the other for her sight to gain
dil phir tavaf-e-ku-e-malamat ko jaae hai

My heart repeatedly repairs to those avenues
pindar ka sanam-kada viran kiye hue

Where I will lose all self respect, be subject to abuse
phir shauq kar raha hai kharidar ki talab

Love once again is eager for a customer to find
Offering up all the wealth of heart, life and mind

dauḌe hai phir har ek gul-o-lala par khayal
My thoughts do flit at every beauty, tulip be or rose

sad-gulsitan nigah ka saman kiye hue
A hundred gardens in my eyes, find easy repose

phir chahta huun nama-e-dildar kholna
Again I'd like to unseal the missive from my lover

My life's forfeit, at the alluring, title on the cover
mange hai phir kisi ko lab-e-bam par havas

Desire seeks that someone to, out on the terrace be
zulf-e-siyah rukh pe pareshan kiye hue

Her tresses dark, strewn across her face seductively
chahe hai phir kisi ko muqabil men aarzu

Wishes want that someone to, be face to face with me
surme se tez dashna-e-mizhgan kiye hue

The daggers of her lashes honed, by kohl's ebony
ik nau-bahar-e-naz ko taake hai phir nigah

For a youthful beauty 'gain thirst these eyes of mine
chehra farogh-e-mai se gulistan kiye hue

Her face being all ablossom then with the glow of wine
phir ji men hai ki dar pe kisi ke paḌe rahen

I feel like standing once again at somebody's gate
Pleading with her sentinel with my head oblate
