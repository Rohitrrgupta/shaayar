us bazm men mujhe nahin banti haya kiye
I couldn't chance at bashfulness, there in her company

baiTha raha agarche ishare hua kiye
though signaled to get up and leave, stayed sitting stubbornly

dil hi to hai siyasat-e-darban se Dar gaya
Tis just a heart, so it got scared then by your sentry's clout

main aur jaun dar se tire bin sada kiye
else I from your doorstep depart sans even calling out

rakhta phirun huun khirqa o sajjada rahn-e-mai
I for a draught of wine do my possessions seek to pawn

muddat hui hai davat ab-o-hava kiye
has ages been since to a feast of drinking I have gone

be-sarfa hi guzarti hai ho garche umr-e-khizr
it wasted then would surely be, if Khizr's lifespan obtained,

hazrat bhi kal kahenge ki ham kya kiya kiye
will himself wonder and query well what have I attained

maqdur ho to khaak se puchhun ki ai laiim
if had capacity would ask the earth O miser say

tu ne vo ganj-ha-e-garan-maya kya kiye
what have you done with all those precious treasures come your way

kis roz tohmaten na tarasha kiye adu
pray when did not my enemies with pointed barbs accuse

kis din hamare sar pe na aare chala kiye
which day upon my head were not, say, sharpened saws in use

sohbat men ghair ki na paḌi ho kahin ye khu
I hope she hasn't learnt this form, at my rival's behest

dene laga hai bosa baghair iltija kiye
she's started giving kisses now, with nary a request

zid ki hai aur baat magar khu buri nahin
her nature, stubbornness apart, is not bad, I am thrilled

bhule se us ne saikḌon vaade vafa kiye
she in her absent-mindedness, has several vows fulfilled

'ghalib' tumhin kaho ki milega javab kya
you think her response you'll receive do tell me truthfully

maana ki tum kaha kiye aur vo suna kiye
though I agree while you beseeched, she listened carefully
