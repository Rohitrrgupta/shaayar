jis sar ko ghurur aaj hai yaan taj-vari ka
the head that's held high today because it wears a crown

kal us pe yahin shor hai phir nauhagari ka
tomorrow, here itself, will in lamentation drown

sharminda tire rukh se hai rukhsar pari ka
your face puts the beauty of the angels all to shame

chalta nahin kuchh aage tire kabk-e-dari ka
to your graceful gait compared, appears the partridge lame

afaq ki manzil se gaya kaun salamat
from worlds of these horizons who did ever safe depart

asbab luTa raah men yaan har safari ka
way-laid and empty handed each traveller did part

zindan men bhi shorish na gai apne junun ki
even while imprisoned, did my craziness endure

ab sang mudava hai is ashufta-sari ka
seems now for my insanity, stoning is

har zakhm-e-jigar davar-e-mahshar se hamara
on judgement day, to God submits a plea

insaf-talab hai tiri bedad-gari ka
seeking justice, recompense against your cruelty

apni to jahan aankh laḌi phir vahin dekho
whoever did enchant my eye there only did I stare

aine ko lapka hai pareshan-nazari ka
whereas the mirror's eye is prone to darting here and there

sad mausam-e-gul ham ko tah-e-bal hi guzre
with head tucked under arm, a hundred springs I stayed

maqdur na dekha kabhu be-bal-o-pari ka
the power of my winglessness I never have assayed

is rang se jhamke hai palak par ki kahe tu
to my eyelashes such a gleam, you say, it does impart

TukḌa hai mira ashk aqiq-e-jigari ka
my teardrop is a fragment of my ruby coloured heart

kal sair kiya ham ne samundar ko bhi ja kar
yesterday to view the ocean too I had gone near

tha dast-e-nigar panja-e-mizhgan ki tari ka
it, longingly, eyeing my teary lashes did appear

le saans bhi ahista ki nazuk hai bahut kaam
breathe here softly as with fragility here all is fraught

afaq ki is kargah-e-shishagari ka
in this workshop of the world where wares of glass are wrought

Tuk 'mir'-e-jigar-sokhta ki jald khabar le
after Miir of burning heart, you should quickly enquire

kya yaar bharosa hai charagh-e-sahari ka
for who can say how long the morning lamp will be afire
