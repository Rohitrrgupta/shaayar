garmi-e-hasrat-e-nakam se jal jaate hain
I burn up in the flames of unfulfilled desire

ham charaghon ki tarah shaam se jal jaate hain
like lanterns are, at eventide I am set afire

shama jis aag men jalti hai numaish ke liye
the fire,that the flame burns in, for all to see

ham usi aag men gumnam se jal jaate hain
In that very fire I do burn but namelessly

bach nikalte hain agar atish-e-sayyal se ham
If from the hunter's fire I manage to escape

shola-e-ariz-e-gulfam se jal jaate hain
I perish in the fire that's in the flower's cape

exhibition's not the norm for those that faithful be
jin ko jalna ho vo aram se jal jaate hain

those who wish to perish then do so quietly
rabt-e-baham pe hamen kya na kahenge dushman

at our mutual fondness why will enemies not fret
ashna jab tire paigham se jal jaate hain

when even friends, at your messages, are all het
jab bhi aata hai mira naam tire naam ke saath

whenever my name happens to be linked to thee
jaane kyuun log mire naam se jal jaate hain

I wonder why these people burn with jealousy
