ki vafa ham se to ghair is ko jafa kahte hain
When she's loyal to me others, carp cavil complain

hoti aai hai ki achchhon ko bura kahte hain
To rant against what's good has been the world's refrain

aaj ham apni pareshani-e-khatir un se
For sake of my afflictions I do go to her today

kahne jaate to hain par dekhiye kya kahte hain
But when I get there let us see what I have to say

agle vaqton ke hain ye log inhen kuchh na kaho
These people are from other times nothing to them tell

jo mai o naghma ko andoh-ruba kahte hain
They who think that wine and song can sorrows repel

dil men aa jaae hai hoti hai jo fursat ghash se
She comes into my heart when I recover from my thrall

aur phir kaun se naale ko rasa kahte hain
If not an answer to ones prayers what this can you then call

hai par-e-sarhad-e-idrak se apna masjud
The one I bow to is beyond, what knowledge can see

qible ko ahl-e-nazar qibla-numa kahte hain
The wise ones deem the qaaba merely to a compass be

pa-e-afgar pe jab se tujhe rahm aaya hai
Since you have shown kindness to my wounded feet

khar-e-rah ko tire ham mehr-e-giya kahte hain
I am thankful to these thorns lying on the street

ik sharar dil men hai us se koi ghabraega kya
In my heart there is a spark, why should it cause fright

aag matlub hai ham ko jo hava kahte hain
I breathe to give it air as I hope it would ignite

dekhiye laati hai us shokh ki nakhvat kya rang
What colours will her mischievous pride today reveal

us ki har baat pe ham nam-e-khuda kahte hain
At everything she says I will to God's mercy appeal

'vahshat' o 'shefta' ab marsiya kahven shayad
By vahshat and sheftaa,today, elegies may be read

mar gaya 'ghalib'-e-ashufta-nava kahte hain
That rambling Gaalib, we have heard, finally is dead
