naqsh fariyadi hai kis ki shokhi-e-tahrir ka
For favours from whose playful hand, does the word aspire

kaghzi hai pairahan har paikar-e-tasvir ka
Each one's an abject supplicant in paper-like attire

kaav kav-e-sakht-jani hae-tanhai na puchh
What constant pain this loneliness you may not believe

subh karna shaam ka laana hai ju-e-shir ka
Like from mountains drawing milk, is passing morn to eve

The spirit of love's frenzied state is worth, truly, seeing
sina-e-shamshir se bahar hai dam shamshir ka

As though sharpness of the sword exists outside its being
agahi dam-e-shunidan jis qadar chahe bichhae

Awareness may well cast its net of knowing all around
muddaa anqa hai apne alam-e-taqrir ka

What I speak is like a phoenix, unknowable, profound
bas-ki huun 'ghalib' asiri men bhi atish zer-e-pa

Even in bondage, passion's so, there's fire neath my feet
mu-e-atish diida hai halqa miri zanjir ka

The chains that hold me are as though,hair singed by fire's heat
atishin-pa huun gudaz-e-vahshat-e-zindan na puchh

mu-e-atish diida hai har halqa yaan zanjir ka
dam-e-sabza men hai parvaz-e-chaman taskhir ka

naal atish men hai tegh-e-yar se nakhchir ka
khisht pusht-e-dast-e-ijz o qalib aghosh-e-vidaa

pur hua hai sail se paimana kis taamir ka
jo maza jauhar nahin aina-e-taabir ka
