ghar hamara jo na rote bhi to viran hota
had I not wept, this my abode, would have been desolate

bahr gar bahr na hota to bayaban hota
if sea were not a sea would be a desert incarnate

tangi-e-dil ka gila kya ye vo kafir-dil hai
of heart's constriction why complain, this faithless heart surely

ki agar tang na hota to pareshan hota
if would not be constricted then, would agitated be

baad yak-umr-e-vara baar to deta baare
after a life of abstinence, he wouldn't make me wait

kaash rizvan hi dar-e-yar ka darban hota
if only Heaven's doorman was, the sentry at your gate
