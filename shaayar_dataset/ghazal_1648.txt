gar tujh men hai vafa to jafakar kaun hai
if you harbour loyalty / then who is treacherous

dildar tu hua to dil-azar kaun hai
if you are benevolent / then who is barbarous

nalan huun muddaton se tire saae ke tale
for ages I'm lamenting here / underneath your shade

puchha na ye kabhu pas-e-divar kaun hai
to ask who is behind the wall / you never essayed

har shab sharab-khvar har ik din siyah hai
every night's immersed in wine / and dark is every day

ashufta zulf o laTpaTi dastar kaun hai
who is that with hair awry, headwrap in disarray

har aan dekhta huun main apne sanam ko shaikh
preacher, every moment my / beloved I have seen

tere khuda ka talib-e-didar kaun hai
for a vision of your God, do tell me who is keen

'sauda' ko jurm-e-ishq se karte hain aaj qatl
for his crime of passion / 'sauda's' being slain today

pahchanta hai tu ye gunahgar kaun hai
do you recognise who is / this sinner, by the way
