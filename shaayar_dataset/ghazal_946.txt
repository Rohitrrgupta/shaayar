hairan huun dil ko rouun ki piTun jigar ko main
Should I cry out for my heart or liver then lament

maqdur ho to saath rakhun nauhagar ko main
If I had the money, on a mourner would have spent

chhoḌa na rashk ne ki tire ghar ka naam luun
From naming your home address, did jealousy impede

har ik se puchhta huun ki jaun kidhar ko main
I asked each person that I met where do I proceed

jaana paḌa raqib ke dar par hazar baar
To my rival's stead a thousand times I had to go

ai kaash janta na tire rah-guzar ko main
Would it be, the path you often tread I did not know

hai kya jo kas ke bandhiye meri bala Dare
What is it that's drawn so tight, calamity may care

kya janta nahin huun tumhari kamar ko main
As to the truth about your waist am I so unaware

lo vo bhi kahte hain ki ye be-nang-o-nam hai
Lo even she proclaims me be sans money or repute

ye janta agar to luTata na ghar ko main
Had this I known I never would subject my home to loot

chalta huun thoḌi duur har ik tez-rau ke saath
Short distances I walk with every one who moves apace

pahchanta nahin huun abhi rahbar ko main
I know not yet who is the guide nor recognize his face

khvahish ko ahmaqon ne parastish diya qarar
Desire is deemed to be worship by these foolish men

kya pujta huun us but-e-bedad-gar ko main
Do I truly venerate that cruel idol then

phir be-khudi men bhuul gaya rah-e-ku-e-yar
To my beloved's house, in stupor, I have lost the way

jaata vagarna ek din apni khabar ko main
Else to get news about myself

I'd surely go one day
apne pe kar raha huun qayas ahl-e-dahr ka

People of this world are like me- I was thus deceived
samjha huun dil-pazir mata-e-hunar ko main

Pleasing to the heart, the wealth of talent, I believed
'ghalib' khuda kare ki savar-e-samand-e-naz

Gaalib may the Lord ordain he ride the horse of pride
dekhun ali bahadur-e-ali-guhar ko main

So I may see Ali bahaadur virtuous astride
