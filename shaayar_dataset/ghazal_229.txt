kyunkar us but se rakhun jaan aziiz
how shall I keep life do say, from that idol free

kya nahin hai mujhe iman aziiz
do you think that my faith and creed

are not dear to me
dil se nikla pe na nikla dil se

though from my heart it did depart, yet it did not free
hai tire tiir ka paikan aziiz

your arrow's pointed tip you see, is so dear to me
taab laae hi banegi 'ghalib'

Gaalib forbearance needs be brought, somehow surely
vaqia sakht hai aur jaan aziiz

the incident is grievous and, life is dear to me
