asar us ko zara nahin hota
she remains unmoved and hard to please

my pain persists, does not provide release
bevafa kahne ki shikayat hai

she objects being labelled faithless still
to bhi vada-vafa nahin hota

not a single vow does she fulfil
mention of my rivals made me know

the preacher's word isn't harsh somehow
kis ko hai zauq-e-talkh-kami lek

jang bin kuchh maza nahin hota
tum hamare kisi tarah na hue

your love by any means I could not gain
varna duniya men kya nahin hota

Or else in life what would not one attain
us ne kya jaane kya kiya le kar

I wonder why she took my heart away
dil kisi kaam ka nahin hota

it is of no avail I've heard them say
imtihan kijiye mira jab tak

ek dushman ki charkh hai na rahe
that heavens be my enemy no more

tujh se ye ai dua nahin hota
this task, prayers, you cannot ensure

my efforts daily multiply and yet
garche ik muddaa nahin hota

the only thing I want I do not get
tum mire paas hote ho goya

in such a manner are you close to me
jab koi dusra nahin hota

when no one else at all there ever be
hal-e-dil yaar ko likhun kyunkar

to her, how do I write my state of heart
haath dil se juda nahin hota

from my heart my hand just cannot part
rahm kar khasm-e-jan-e-ghair na ho

sab ka dil ek sa nahin hota
daman us ka jo hai daraz to ho

she may be generous, still it is in vain
a lover's hand does not ever attain

no cure, save patience, can there ever be
so tumhare siva nahin hota

and that, without you, will not come to me
distressed pleas, why will she heed

sanam akhir khuda nahin hota
a paramour she is, not God indeed
