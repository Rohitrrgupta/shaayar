roya karenge aap bhi pahron isi tarah
you too will end up weeping hours, in this very way

aTka kahin jo aap ka dil bhi miri tarah
if your heart, like mine, is this entangled some day

aata nahin hai vo to kisi Dhab se daav men
she is not ensnared by any tactic I pursue

banti nahin hai milne ki us ke koi tarah
there is no way to meet her whatever I may do

tashbih kis se duun ki tarah-dar ki mire
for my dearest one how do I find a similie

sab se nirali vaza hai sab se nai tarah
her manner is unique and new as no one else can be

mar chuk kahin ki tu gham-e-hijran se chhuT jaae
go die somewhere to get release from separation's pain

kahte to hain bhale ki va-lekin buri tarah
she means well although she talks in a vicious vein

ne taab hijr men hai na aram vasl men
no peace in separation, nor in union ease

kam-bakht dil ko chain nahin hai kisi tarah
this hapless heart is restless, do whatever I please

lagti hain galiyan bhi tire munh se kya bhali
even your abuse sounds sweet to my ears, its true

qurban tere phir mujhe kah le usi tarah
keep on in this tone and my life belongs to you

pamal ham na hote faqat jaur-e-charkh se
I would not be trampled only by heaven's excess

aai hamari jaan pe aafat kai tarah
my life indeed has undergone so many kinds of stress

ne jaae vaan bane hai na bin jaae chain hai
neither can I go there, nor can I stay away

kya kijiye hamen to hai mushkil sabhi tarah
what can I do I am constrained, each and every way

maashuq aur bhi hain bata de jahan men
in this world, there'd surely be, other beloveds too

karta hai kaun zulm kisi par tiri tarah
tell me is there anyone as cruel as you

huun jan-ba-lab butan-e-sitamgar ke haath se
my life hangs on edge due to these idol's cruelty

kya sab jahan men jiite hain 'momin' isi tarah
does everybody in this world momin live like me
