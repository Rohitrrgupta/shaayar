khamosh ho kyuun dad-e-jafa kyuun nahin dete
why are you silent, why don’t you applaud her cruelty

bismil ho to qatil ko dua kyuun nahin dete
why don’t you then bless the killer, if injured you be

vahshat ka sabab rauzan-e-zindan to nahin hai
the prison window well may be cause for insanity

mehr o mah o anjum ko bujha kyuun nahin dete
why not douse the moon and stars' soft serenity

ik ye bhi to andaz-e-ilaj-e-gham-e-jan hai
this too is used as a means to render remedy

ai charagaro dard baḌha kyuun nahin dete
healers why don't you increase my pain's intensity

munsif ho agar tum to kab insaf karoge
when will you render justice, if, a judge you claim to be

mujrim hain agar ham to saza kyuun nahin dete
and if a criminal I am, why don’t you punish me

rahzan ho to hazir hai mata-e-dil-o-jan bhi
if be a highway robber, heart and life, at your mercy

rahbar ho to manzil ka pata kyuun nahin dete
and if you be a guide, why not, point out the path to me

kya biit gai ab ke 'faraz' ahl-e-chaman par
what has befallen people of the garden suddenly

yaran-e-qafas mujh ko sada kyuun nahin dete
companions of my prison why no longer call to me
