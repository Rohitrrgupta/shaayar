ulTi ho gaiin sab tadbiren kuchh na dava ne kaam kiya
Stratagems all came apart, no cure could render remedy

dekha is bimari-e-dil ne akhir kaam tamam kiya
it was this ailment of my heart, that finished me off finally

ahd-e-javani ro ro kaaTa piiri men liin ankhen muund
Copious tears, in youth I shed, in dotage shut eyes tiredly

yaani raat bahut the jaage subh hui aram kiya
night I stayed away from bed, come morning now lie peacefully

harf nahin jan-bakhshi men us ki khubi apni qismat ki
'tis my fate that's inclement, no fault is of her clemency

ham se jo pahle kah bheja so marne ka paigham kiya
message that she earlier sent, happened to be a death decree

nahaq ham majburon par ye tohmat hai mukhtari ki
Us weak, she wrongfully accuses, of taking untold liberty

chahte hain so aap karen hain ham ko abas badnam kiya
while she acts as she chooses, and maligns us needlessly

saare rind aubash jahan ke tujh se sujud men rahte hain
all drunks and vagabonds that be, of the world submit to thee

banke TeḌhe tirchhe tikhe sab ka tujh ko imaam kiya
crooked, crafty, bent, shifty, their leader all they deem you be

sarzad ham se be-adabi to vahshat men bhi kam hi hui
even in a maddened state, irreverent I could not be

koson us ki or gae par sajda har har gaam kiya
Miles I went towards her gate, kowtowing incessantly

kis ka kaaba kaisa qibla kaun haram hai kya ehram
what is mecca's mosque and say who is concerned with piety

kuche ke us ke bashindon ne sab ko yahin se salam kiya
in her street who choose to stay, bow from here itself you see

shaikh jo hai masjid men nanga raat ko tha mai-khane men
the priest nude in the mosque today, last night in the tavern he

jubba khirqa kurta Topi masti men inaam kiya
gave all his pious clothes away, whilst on a drunken spree

kaash ab burqa munh se uTha de varna phir kya hasil hai
if her face she would unveil,whilst alive I chanced to be

aankh munde par un ne go didar ko apne aam kiya
if later then to what avail, if her face then all could see

yaan ke sapid o siyah men ham ko dakhl jo hai so itna hai
in this play of black and white,'tis all I am allowed to be

raat ko ro ro subh kiya ya din ko juun tuun shaam kiya
Bring in the dawn, crying all night, spend dawn to dusk in agony

subh chaman men us ko kahin taklif-e-hava le aai thi
perchance the morning breeze had paved her journey to the bower

rukh se gul ko mol liya qamat se sarv ghulam kiya
the cypress by her form enslaved, and by her face the flower

saad-e-simin donon us ke haath men la kar chhoḌ diye
both her silver wrists I held in my hands then set them free

bhule us ke qaul-o-qasam par haae khayal-e-kham kiya
how her promises dispelled my senses, made a fool of me

kaam hue hain saare zaaea har saaat ki samajat se
all my efforts were annuled by my beseeching constantly

istighna ki chauguni un ne juun juun main ibram kiya
her indifference just quadrupled, the more I sought insistently

aise ahu-e-ram-khurda ki vahshat khoni mushkil thi
for such a swift alert gazelle, 'tis hard to shed timidity

sehr kiya eajaz kiya jin logon ne tujh ko raam kiya
if someone could rein in, compel, a miracle 'twould surely be

'mir' ke din-o-mazhab ko ab puchhte kya ho un ne to
Why is it you seek to know, of Miir's religion, sect, for he

qashqa khincha dair men baiTha kab ka tark islam kiya
Sits in temples, painted brow, well on the road to heresy
