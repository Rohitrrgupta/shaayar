kahte ho na denge ham dil agar paḌa paaya
you say you will not give my heart, if you find it around

dil kahan ki gum kiije ham ne muddaa paaya
where do I have a heart to lose, my fate, for I have found

ishq se tabiat ne ziist ka maza paaya
my being did, from love's domain, the joy of life procure

dard ki dava paai dard-e-be-dava paaya
obtained such cure for life's travails, which itself had no cure

to my beloved enemy, my heart chose to defect
aah be-asar dekhi naala na-rasa paaya

my cries remain without relief, my sighs without effect
sadgi o purkari be-khudi o hushyari

their guile mixed with naivete, stupor with vigilance
husn ko taghaful men jurat-azma paaya

beauty, in apathy, is found, to test their beau's essence
ghuncha phir laga khilne aaj ham ne apna dil

the bud, again, began to bloom,
today my heart I see

khuun kiya hua dekha gum kiya hua paaya
that was long lost has now been found, bloodied to such degree

hal-e-dil nahin maalum lekin is qadar yaani
I know not where my heart may be, but this much comes to mind

ham ne bar-ha DhunDa tum ne bar-ha paaya
that every time we searched for it, you were the one to find

shor-e-pand-e-naseh ne zakhm par namak chhiḌka
the preacher's noisy remonstrance, salt on my wound did strew

aap se koi puchhe tum ne kya maza paaya
someone should go and ask of him how does this gladden you

hai kahan tamanna ka dusra qadam ya rab
ham ne dasht-e-imkan ko ek naqsh-e-pa paaya

ek bekasi tujh ko alam-ashna paaya
yaas ko do-alam se lab-ba-khanda va paaya

kyuun na vahshat-e-ghalib baj-khvah-e-taskin ho
fikr-e-nala men goya halqa huun ze-sar-ta-pa

uzv uzv juun zanjir yak-dil-e-sada paaya
shab nazara-parvar tha khvab men khayal us ka

subh mauja-e-gul ko naqsh-e-boriya paaya
jis qadar jigar khuun ho kucha dadan-e-gul hai

zakhm-e-tegh-e-qatil ko turfa dil-kusha paaya
hai makin ki pa-dari nam-e-sahib-e-khana

ham se tere kuche ne naqsh-e-muddaa paaya
