chalte ho to chaman ko chaliye kahte hain ki baharan hai
to the garden let's repair, I've heard that spring is in the air

paat hare hain phuul khile hain kam-kam bad-o-baran hai
flowers bloom,leaves are green, a gentle breeze and shower fare

rang hava se yuun Tapke hai jaise sharab chuvate hain
just like trickling wine appear colours from the air that souse

aage ho mai-khane ke niklo ahd-e-bada-gusaran hai
through the tavern let's proceed, tis the season to carouse

ishq ke maidan-daron men bhi marne ka hai vasf bahut
in love's field, mettle to face death possess

yaani musibat aisi uThana kar-e-kar-guzaran hai
to face such hardships is the work of those who find success

dil hai daagh jigar hai Tuká¸Œe aansu saare khuun hue
the heart is scarred and patience rent, bloody tears now start to run

lohu paani ek kare ye ishq-e-lala-azaran hai
love of rose-faced beauties turns blood and water into one

kohkan o majnun ki khatir dasht-o-koh men ham na gae
cause of Majnuun, Kohkan, wastelands, mountains I eschew

ishq men ham ko 'mir' nihayat pas-e-izzat-daran hai
as lovers and their famed repute, sacrosanct I hold in view
