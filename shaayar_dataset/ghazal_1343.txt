ghuncha-e-na-shagufta ko duur se mat dikha ki yuun
from afar do not display that unopened bud this way

bose ko puchhta huun main munh se mujhe bata ki yuun
when I ask you for a kiss, show me with your mouth, this way

pursish-e-tarz-e-dilbari kijiye kya ki bin kahe
about her heart-stealing ways, what to ask, as ere she says

us ke har ek ishare se nikle hai ye ada ki yuun
her every gesture oozes charm and proclaims

raat ke vaqt mai piye saath raqib ko liye
she partakes wine eventide, and keeps my rival beside

aae vo yaan khuda kare par na kare khuda ki yuun
may Lord make her come to me, but O Lord! no, not this way!

ghair se raat kya bani ye jo kaha to dekhiye
how was your night with my foe, when this I sought to know

samne aan baiThna aur ye dekhna ki yuun
she came and sat in front of me,

then glared as if to say this way
bazm men us ke ru-ba-ru kyuun na khamosh baiThiye

silent why should I not be face to face in company
us ki to khamushi men bhi hai yahi muddaa ki yuun

even her silence implies her meaning that I stay this way
main ne kaha ki bazm-e-naz chahiye ghair se tahi

when I said her company, now from strangers should be free
sun ke sitam-zarif ne mujh ko uTha diya ki yuun

with cruel wit she bid me rise, showed me out saying this way
mujh se kaha jo yaar ne jaate hain hosh kis tarah

when my love asked this of me, show me how your senses flee
dekh ke meri be-khudi chalne lagi hava ki yuun

seeing my stupor wafts of wind stirred to show it was this way
kab mujhe ku-e-yar men rahne ki vaza yaad thi

when in my beloved's lane, I ignorant of form remain
aina-dar ban gai hairat-e-naqsh-e-pa ki yuun

bewilderment of footprints show me you should stay this way
gar tire dil men ho khayal vasl men shauq ka zaval

if, in your heart, you have this fear- in union love may disappear-
mauj muhit-e-ab men maare hai dast-o-pa ki yuun

waves in the ocean thrash their limbs to show it'll be this way
jo ye kahe ki rekhta kyunke ho rashk-e-farsi

if asked how Urdu verse can be the envy of Persian poetry
gufta-e-'ghalib' ek baar paá¸Œh ke use suna ki yuun

read them Ghalib's odes just once, and point out to them this way
