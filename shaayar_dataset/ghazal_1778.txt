gham raha jab tak ki dam men dam raha
As long as ardour lasted, my sorrow I sustained

dil ke jaane ka nihayat gham raha
listless when my heart became, deeply was I pained

husn tha tera bahut alam-fareb
your beauty was deceptive and O! to such extent

khat ke aane par bhi ik aalam raha
even after you matured this wonder never went

dil na pahuncha gosha-e-daman talak
the corner of my vestment my heart never attained

qatra-e-khun tha mizha par jam raha
drop of blood congealed upon my lashes remained

sunte hain laila ke kheme ko siyah
I have heard it said that Lailaa's camp was black and glum

us men majnun ka magar matam raha
maybe they were mourning there for Manjuun's martyrdom

by the sacred garments of the priest be not impressed
tha haram men lek na-mahram raha

he was in the mosque and yet, the truth never possessed
zulfen kholin to tu Tuk aaya nazar

it was when you strewed your tresses that I came to know
umr bhar yaan kam-e-dil barham raha

lifelong here my heart's hopes shall stay scattered anyhow
us ke lab se talkh ham sunte rahe

from her lips, bitterness, was all I did receive;
apne haq men ab-e-haivan sam raha

for me even nectar thus was poisonous, I grieve
mere rone ki haqiqat jis men thi

where the true saga of my weeping was contained
ek muddat tak vo kaghaz nam raha

sodden, moist for ages then, that paper remained
subh-e-piri shaam hone aai 'mir'

the dawn of dotage miir anon will into dusk descend
tu na cheta yaan bahut din kam raha

yet you remained unaware that life is short my friend
