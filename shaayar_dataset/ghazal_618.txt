hai bas-ki har ik un ke ishare men nishan aur
in every gesture of her's, there, ulterior motive lies

karte hain mohabbat to guzarta hai guman aur
when she professes love, therefore, suspicion does arise

ya-rab vo na samjhe hain na samjhenge miri baat
O Lord! She never understood nor ever will my plea

de aur dil un ko jo na de mujh ko zaban aur
give her another heart or else the gift of speech to me

abru se hai kya us nigah-e-naz ko paivand
her glance is not connected to the arch upon her brow

hai tiir muqarrar magar is ki hai kaman aur
an arrow it is certainly, but somewhere else the bow

tum shahr men ho to hamen kya gham jab uThenge
when your'e in town why should I fret at losing life and heart

le aenge bazar se ja kar dil o jaan aur
from lovesick suitors I can buy these freely in the mart

har chand subuk-dast hue but-shikani men
although in breaking idols I, can claim celerity

ham hain to abhi raah men hai sang-e-giran aur
so long as I exists till then, stones in the path will be

hai khun-e-jigar josh men dil khol ke rota
blood of my liver's patience boils, my heart would freely weep

hote jo kai dida-e-khun-naba-fishan aur
if many more eyes could obtain, from which this blood wcould seep

marta huun is avaz pe har chand sar uḌ jaae
I die to hear that voice, although, my head it may sever

jallad ko lekin vo kahe jaaen ki haan aur
yes! strike again she keeps telling, the executioner

logon ko hai khurshid-e-jahan-tab ka dhoka
in error, world-illuming sun men think it when they view

har roz dikhata huun main ik dagh-e-nihan aur
each day, a burning scar concealed, that I display anew

leta na agar dil tumhen deta koi dam chain
had I not given you my heart, life would, in peace, have spent

karta jo na marta koi din ah-o-fughan aur
had I not died, would bide my time, in weeping and lament

paate nahin jab raah to chaḌh jaate hain naale
when they don't find path to escape, rivers tend to rise

rukti hai miri taba to hoti hai ravan aur
thus when my temperament's contrained, further intensifies

hain aur bhi duniya men sukhan-var bahut achchhe
while there are many poets great, for in the world to speak

kahte hain ki 'ghalib' ka hai andaz-e-bayan aur
but it is said that Gaalib does, possess a style unique
