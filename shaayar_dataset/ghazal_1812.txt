no longer worthy is my heart of being in love with her
vo valvala vo josh vo tughiyan nahin raha

that zeal, that fervor, that tumult, now no longer appear
ThanDa hai garm-joshi-e-afsurdagi se ji

my heart is cold it lacks the heat of soulful agony
kaisa asar ki nala-o-afghan nahin raha

what can result wail and lament now all are lost to me
karte hain apne zakhm-e-jigar ko rafu ham aap

on my own I seek to darn the wounds upon my heart
kuchh bhi khayal-e-jumbish-e-mizhgan nahin raha

the tremor of those lashes no longer play a part
dil-sakhtiyon se aai tabiat men nazuki

hardships 'pon my heart have served to weaken my core
patience and endurance for life's troubles are no more

ghash hain ki be-dimagh hain gul-pairahan namat
I am glad to be as callous as the one in floral dress

no longer does the longing for her perfume prepossess
ankhen na badlen shokh-nazar kyuun ke ab ki main

say why should she not turn away her glance from me for I
no longer am enamoured of the the speck within her eye

nakamiyon ka gaah gila gaah shukr hai
for failures I am grateful times and at times complain

shauq-e-visal o anduh-e-hijran nahin raha
the joy of meeting is no more, nor is parting's pain

be-tuda tuda-khak subuk-dosh ho gae
sar par junun-e-ishq ka ehsan nahin raha

har lahza mehr-jalvon se hain chashm-poshiyan
phirte hain kaise parda-nashinon se munh chhupae

I run around hiding my face from those beauties veiled
rusva hue ki ab gham-e-pinhan nahin raha

I am disgraced my hidden pain to all has been revealed
ai uns ik nazar ki main insan nahin raha

bekari-e-umid se fursat hai raat din
day and night now I am free from hope's futility

the business of despair and hope no longer interests me
be-sair-e-dasht-o-badiya lagne laga hai ji

My heart is now at ease although the wilds I do not roam
aur is kharab ghar men ki viran nahin raha

and desolation finally has left this ruined home
kya talkh-kamiyon ne lab-e-zakhm si diye

has bitterness sewed up the lips of my every wound
that frenzied longing for salt bins is no longer found

be-e'tibar ho gae ham tark-e-ishq se
a disbeliever I became, from love, once, I forswore

az-bas ki pas-e-vada-o-paiman nahin raha
I have faith in troths and vows of constancy no more
