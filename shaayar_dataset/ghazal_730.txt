kahun jo haal to kahte ho muddaa kahiye
when I narrate my sorry state, you ask what do you seek

tumhin kaho ki jo tum yuun kaho to kya kahiye
if in this vein you talk to me, how can I ever speak

na kahiyo taan se phir tum ki ham sitamgar hain
this, proudly you should never say, I am a tyrant, true

mujhe to khu hai ki jo kuchh kaho baja kahiye
As I am in the habit of always agreeing with you

vo neshtar sahi par dil men jab utar jaave
though dagger it may surely be, does to my heart attend

nigah-e-naz ko phir kyuun na ashna kahiye
why should I then not call her glance, a confidant and friend

incision of her arrow causes comfort nor release
vo zakhm-e-tegh hai jis ko ki dil-kusha kahiye

it is the wound caused by her sword, which does my heart appease
jo muddai bane us ke na muddai baniye

he who with you bears enmity, be not his enemy
jo na-saza kahe us ko na na-saza kahiye

to him who speaks abusively, speak not abusively
places you write the truth about ailment's fatality

and places then you talk about the cure's infirmity
times you complain of sorrow that just will not go away

and times you tell the story that, your patience will not stay
rahe na jaan to qatil ko khun-baha diije

blood money to the murderer, pay, if you lose your life
kaTe zaban to khanjar ko marhaba kahiye

and if your tongue be severerd then, say thank you to the knife
nahin nigar ko ulfat na ho nigar to hai

if my beloved loves me not, beloved still will be
still will remain her flowing gait, and heady coquetry

nahin bahar ko fursat na ho bahar to hai
let spring not have time to abide, at least it did appear

talk of the garden's verdancy and breeze that blows now here
safina jab ki kinare pe aa laga 'ghalib'

when safety of the shore, your vessel managed to attain
khuda se kya sitam-o-jaur-e-na-khuda kahiye

why then, to God, of the pilot's tyranny and force complain
