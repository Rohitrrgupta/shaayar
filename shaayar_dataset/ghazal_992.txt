jis zakhm ki ho sakti ho tadbir rafu ki
a wound which can by stitching seal and find its remedy

likh dijiyo ya rab use qismat men adu ki
such wound, O lord, you may write in my rival's destiny

achchha hai sar-angusht-e-hinai ka tasavvur
tis good that thought of henna painted fingers comes to mind

dil men nazar aati to hai ik buund lahu ki
for, in my heart, a drop of blood I now at least can find

kyuun Darte ho ushshaq ki be-hauslagi se
what reason that you are afraid that lovers lack restraint

yaan to koi sunta nahin fariyad kisu ki
for none here pays slightest heed to anybody's plaint

dashne ne kabhi munh na lagaya ho jigar ko
alas a hundred times alas my end I didn't attain

khanjar ne kabhi baat na puchhi ho gulu ki
I, for a bellicose beloved, longing did remain

sad-haif vo nakam ki ik umr se 'ghalib'
to bring my liver to its lips a dagger never tried

hasrat men rahe ek but-e-arbada-ju ki
and conversation with a knife, my throat too was denied

itna hai ki rahti to hai tadbir vazu ki
