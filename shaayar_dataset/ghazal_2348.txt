ghar jab bana liya tire dar par kahe baghair
At your door, I have encamped, without taking consent

janega ab bhi tu na mira ghar kahe baghair
Even now you'll think it not my home, till I comment

kahte hain jab rahi na mujhe taqat-e-sukhan
She asks me when my speech is gone, when I am frail and weak

janun kisi ke dil ki main kyunkar kahe baghair
how can I fathom your desires, when you will not speak

kaam us se aa paḌa hai ki jis ka jahan men
Favours I do seek from her, with her I've work you see

leve na koi naam sitamgar kahe baghair
She whose very name invokes complaints of tyranny

ji men hi kuchh nahin hai hamare vagarna ham
There's nothing in my heart that I wish to communicate

sar jaae ya rahe na rahen par kahe baghair
Else even were my life forefeit I would surely narrate

chhoḌunga main na us but-e-kafir ka pujna
To stop worshipping that idol fair, I will not agree

chhoḌe na khalq go mujhe kafar kahe baghair
And this world will not refrain from crying heresy!

maqsad hai naz-o-ghamza vale guftugu men kaam
Tho I do describe her glance, no one can really see

chalta nahin hai dashna-o-khanjar kahe baghair
Till such time I do not draw a dagger's similie

har chand ho mushahida-e-haq ki guftugu
On nature of eternal truth were there to be discourse

banti nahin hai bada-o-saghar kahe baghair
Sans mention of goblet and wine there is no recourse

bahra huun main to chahiye duuna ho iltifat
As I am hard of hearing so, kindness should be replete

sunta nahin huun baat mukarrar kahe baghair
I cannot understand your words until you don’t repeat

'ghalib' na kar huzur men tu baar baar arz
Ghalib do not repeatedly plead in her presence so

zahir hai tera haal sab un par kahe baghair
Your condition, ere you speak, she does surely know
