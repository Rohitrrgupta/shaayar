ham par jafa se tark-e-vafa ka guman nahin
ik chheá¸Œ hai vagarna murad imtihan nahin

kis munh se shukr kijiye is lutf-e-khas ka
pursish hai aur pa-e-sukhan darmiyan nahin

ham ko sitam aziiz sitamgar ko ham aziiz
The tyrant holds me dear and I too relish tyranny

na-mehrban nahin hai agar mehrban nahin
thus she is not unkind even if, she's not kind to me

bosa nahin na dijiye dushnam hi sahi
if you won't kiss me its all right, you can at least abuse

akhir zaban to rakhte ho tum gar dahan nahin
if you don't possess a mouth, your tongue should surely use

e'en though her anger,wrath dissolve my life so totally
and even though support of strength and courage there not be

life is a minstrel with a song seeking severity
lips don't intone a plaintive chant beseeching sanctuary

khanjar se chiir siina agar dil na ho do-nim
should cleave your breast with dagger if your heart is not in two

dil men chhuri chubho mizha gar khun-chakan nahin
should plunge a knife into your heart , if, lashes, blood not spew

hai nang-e-sina dil agar atish-kada na ho
the heart's a blot upon one's breast, if flames do not imbue

hai ar-e-dil nafas agar azar-fishan nahin
and breath is shameful for the heart, if fire does not strew

nuqsan nahin junun men bala se ho ghar kharab
no loss would be if in frenzy, home turns to ruined heap

sau gaz zamin ke badle bayaban giran nahin
as in exchange for hundred yards, the wilderness comes cheap

kahte ho kya likha hai tiri sarnavisht men
you ask me what is this inscribed in lines of your forehead

goya jabin pe sajda-e-but ka nishan nahin
as though my brow does not bear signs of rubbing 'gainst your stead

paata huun us se daad kuchh apne kalam ki
praise I receive from Gabriel for this my style of verse

ruhul-qudus agarche mira ham-zaban nahin
despite that in a common tongue we two do not converse

jaan hai baha-e-bosa vale kyuun kahe abhi
a kiss is worth a life complete, why for will she now say

'ghalib' ko janta hai ki vo nim-jan nahin
because she knows that Gaalib is not half dead yet today

jis ja ki pa-e-sail-e-bala darmiyan nahin
divanagan ko vaan havas-e-khanman nahin

gul ghunchagi men gharqa-e-dariya-e-rang hai
ai agahi fareb-e-tamasha kahan nahin

kis jurm se hai chashm tujhe hasrat qubul
