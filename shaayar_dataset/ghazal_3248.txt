sham-e-firaq ab na puchh aai aur aa ke Tal gai
Query not my lonely night it came and went away

dil tha ki phir bahal gaya jaan thi ki phir sambhal gai
The heart was consoled and life managed not to fray

bazm-e-khayal men tire husn ki shama jal gai
In the parlour of my thoughts your beauty's lamp was lit

dard ka chand bujh gaya hijr ki raat Dhal gai
The moon of pain vanished again, the night of parting quit

jab tujhe yaad kar liya subh mahak mahak uThi
When your thoughts arose, fragrant was the morn

jab tira gham jaga liya raat machal machal gai
When your sorrow's woke, the night was all forlorn

dil se to har moamla kar ke chale the saaf ham
I ventured forth with all my thoughts properly arranged

kahne men un ke samne baat badal badal gai
In her presence when I spoke, the meaning had all changed

akhir-e-shab ke ham-safar 'faiz' na jaane kya hue
Where the night's companions went I do not know

rah gai kis jagah saba subh kidhar nikal gai
Where did the breeze vanish where did the morning go
