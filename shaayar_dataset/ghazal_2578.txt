bulbul ne jise ja ke gulistan men dekha
the songbird to the garden went, that one whom to see

ham ne use har khar-e-bayaban men dekha
in each thorn of wilderness, was visible to me

raushan hai vo har ek sitare men zulekha
Zulekha, each star is by / that brightness glorified

jis nuur ko tu ne sar-e-kanan men dekha
the lustre, that in Canaan city, you once had espied

barham kare jamiyyat-e-kaunain jo pal men
in moments, men and angels both / that which can distress

laTka vo tiri zulf-e-pareshan men dekha
that enchantment I have seen / in your dishevelled tress

vaaiz tu sune bole hai jis roz ki baten
the day of which O preacher, you daily hear and say

us roz ko ham ne shab-e-hijran men dekha
in the night of parting / I too have seen that day

ai zakhm-e-jigar suda-e-almas se khu kar
O heart's wound, with diamond's dust, yourself you should exalt

kitna vo maza tha jo namak-dan men dekha
how great was the delight that lay / in a box of salt

'sauda' jo tira haal hai itna to nahin vo
'sauda' to your plight compared, she is not apropos

kya janiye tu ne use kis aan men dekha
you saw her in what moment I wonder who would know
