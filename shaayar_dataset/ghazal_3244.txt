phir kuchh ik dil ko be-qarari hai
restless again this heart is found

my breast now seeks a deeper wound
phir jigar khodne laga nakhun

'gain nails my liver lacerate
red tulips soon will be in spate

towards the goal are eyes now keen
again the curtain is between

eyes: broker of wares of disgrace
heart: buyer with zest to abase

'gain hundred hues of sad lament
and hundred fold are tears spent

my heart in hope of graceful gait
jalva phir arz-e-naz karta hai

'gain beauty's airs are on display
life is the price you pay today

phir usi bevafa pe marte hain
dying for that faithless one again

phir vahi zindagi hamari hai
my life, the same, does then remain

doors of her court open again
her lover's lawsuits are amain

ho raha hai jahan men andher
now darkness in this world does reign

zulf ki phir sirishta-dari hai
her tresses rule here once again

phir diya para-e-jigar ne saval
heart's pieces file a claim once more

ek fariyad o ah-o-zari hai
plaint and lament is here galore

phir hue hain gavah-e-ishq talab
love's witnesses are in demand

tears need be shed is the command
dil o mizhgan ka jo muqaddama tha

suit tween her lashes and my heart
aaj phir us ki ru-bakari hai

will 'gain be heard today from start
your stupor's not of cause devoid

kuchh to hai jis ki parda-dari hai
there's something that want to hide
