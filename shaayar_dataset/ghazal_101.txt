baat karni mujhe mushkil kabhi aisi to na thi
conversing has never been so diffficult for me

jaisi ab hai tiri mahfil kabhi aisi to na thi
your company now is no more as it used to be

le gaya chhin ke kaun aaj tira sabr o qarar
who is it that's spirited your peace and calm away

be-qarari tujhe ai dil kabhi aisi to na thi
O heart you never were perturbed as you are today

us ki ankhon ne khuda jaane kiya kya jaadu
Lord knows what enchantment her eyes have cast on me

ki tabiat miri maail kabhi aisi to na thi
never was my temperament inclined to this degree

aks-e-rukhsar ne kis ke hai tujhe chamkaya
reflection of whose face is it that causes you to glow

taab tujh men mah-e-kamil kabhi aisi to na thi
O full moon, you've never shone this brightly before

ab ki jo rah-e-mohabbat men uThai taklif
sakht hoti hamen manzil kabhi aisi to na thi

pa-e-kuban koi zindan men naya hai majnun
in jail some lover, newly crazed, is stomping all around

aati avaz-e-salasil kabhi aisi to na thi
never did the clamour of the chains produce this sound

nigah-e-yar ko ab kyuun hai taghaful ai dil
O heart why is my loved one's glance neglectful today

vo tire haal se ghafil kabhi aisi to na thi
it has never been this way

chashm-e-qatil miri dushman thi hamesha lekin
jaisi ab ho gai qatil kabhi aisi to na thi

kya sabab tu jo bigaá¸Œta hai 'zafar' se har baar
what reason zafar's every act you do now deplore

khu tiri hur-shamail kabhi aisi to na thi
houri-face! your nature never was like this before
