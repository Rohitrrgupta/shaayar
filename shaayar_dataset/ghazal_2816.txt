donon jahan teri mohabbat men haar ke
Having lost out both the worlds in his love for you

vo ja raha hai koi shab-e-gham guzar ke
Having spent a night of sorrow someone bids adieu

viran hai mai-kada khum-o-saghar udaas hain
The tavern is forlorn the goblet flask too are blue

tum kya gae ki ruuTh gae din bahar ke
Now that you have left the days of spring have too

ik fursat-e-gunah mili vo bhi chaar din
Leave to sin I did obtain but for days two and two

dekhe hain ham ne hausle parvardigar ke
Courage of the lord divine is there for all to view

duniya ne teri yaad se begana kar diya
This world has caused me to forget all thoughts of you

tujh se bhi dil-fareb hain gham rozgar ke
The sorrows of subsistence are more deceitful than you

bhule se muskura to diye the vo aaj 'faiz'
She did smile, by mistake, today at me anew

mat puchh valvale dil-e-na-karda-kar ke
The joy of my dejected heart I cannot tell you
