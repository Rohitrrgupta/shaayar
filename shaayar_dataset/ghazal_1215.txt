apne hathon ki lakiron men saja le mujh ko
in the fate lines of your hand please do let me be

main huun tera tu nasib apna bana le mujh ko
make me yours my love because I am your destiny

main jo kanTa huun to chal mujh se bacha kar daman
save your cloak from me if I am thought to be a thorn

main huun gar phuul to juuá¸Œe men saja le mujh ko
and if a flower deemed to be then in your hair adorn

tark-e-ulfat ki qasam bhi koi hoti hai qasam
the vow to sever someone's love is no vow at all

tu kabhi yaad to kar bhulne vaale mujh ko
you who have forgotten me someday should recall

mujh se tu puchhne aaya hai vafa ke maani
you come to me asking the meaning of

ye tiri sada-dili maar na Daale mujh ko
your innocence may truly well, be the end of me

main samundar bhi huun moti bhi huun ghota-zan bhi
I am the diver, I'm the pearl, I also am the sea

koi bhi naam mira le ke bula le mujh ko
by any of these names, you may call out to me

tu ne dekha nahin aine se aage kuchh bhi
beside a mirror nothing else have you ever espied

khud-parasti men kahin tu na ganva le mujh ko
in self admiration you may lose me by your side

bandh kar sang-e-vafa kar diya tu ne gharqab
kaun aisa hai jo ab DhunDh nikale mujh ko

khud ko main baanT na Dalun kahin daman daman
tomorrow is another day, same I might not remain

kar diya tu ne agar mere havale mujh ko
however much you wish today you may cause me pain

main khule dar ke kisi ghar ka huun saman pyare
what of wine I will, drink poison happily

tu dabe-panv kabhi aa ke chura le mujh ko
if someones there to take in their arms and tend to me

kal ki baat aur hai main ab sa rahun ya na rahun
in a house with open doors, like valuables I stay

jitna ji chahe tira aaj sata le mujh ko
come someday with padded feet and steal me away

baada phir baada hai main zahr bhi pi jaun 'qatil'
tomorrow is another day, same I might not remain

shart ye hai koi banhon men sambhale mujh ko
however much you wish today you may cause me pain
