he's human, gave his heart to her, what can I even say

hua raqib to ho nama-bar hai kya kahiye

it surely has to come some day, but insists not today

qaza se shikva hamen kis qadar hai kya kahiye
the grievance that I bear 'gainst death, pray, how do I portray

rahe hai yuun gah-o-be-gah ki ku-e-dost ko ab
resides my rival all the time in my beloved's street

agar na kahiye ki dushman ka ghar hai kya kahiye
thus calling it my foe's abode, would then be only meet

zahe karishma ki yuun de rakkha hai ham ko fareb
tis miracle of beauty that she fools me in this way

ki bin kahe hi unhen sab khabar hai kya kahiye
claims that she knows what's in my heart, and leaves me naught to say

samajh ke karte hain bazar men vo pursish-e-hal
she purposely, in the bazaar, seeks after my welfare

ki ye kahe ki sar-e-rahguzar hai kya kahiye
knowing full well that publicly, my plaints I will not air

tumhen nahin hai sar-e-rishta-e-vafa ka khayal
of beginning of faithfulness, you have no least concern

hamare haath men kuchh hai magar hai kya kahiye
there's something in my fist but say, can you even discern

unhen saval pe zom-e-junun hai kyuun laá¸Œiye
why fight with her when she presumes, my pleas to be insane

hamen javab se qat-e-nazar hai kya kahiye
to her replies I pay no heed, as naught I will obtain

hasad saza-e-kamal-e-sukhan hai kya kiije
alas! for excellence in verse, envy's the punishment

sitam baha-e-mata-e-hunar hai kya kahiye
what can one say, torture's the price, for one's accomplisment

kaha hai kis ne ki 'ghalib' bura nahin lekin
though there is no one who will say, Gaalib is good, but pray,

sivae is ke ki ashufta-sar hai kya kahiye
save for the fact frenzied in love, what else is
