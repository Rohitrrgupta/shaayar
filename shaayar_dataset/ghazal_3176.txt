tum jaano tum ko ghair se jo rasm-o-rah ho
your wish, if friendly with my rival you do choose to be

mujh ko bhi puchhte raho to kya gunah ho
what sin accrues if you still keep enquiring after me

nobody from punishment will judgement day then spare
qatil agar raqib hai to tum gavah ho

for if my rival murders, witness you will have to bear
kya vo bhi be-gunah-kush o haq-na-shanas hain

you are not human I concede, the sun and moon are you
maana ki tum bashar nahin khurshid o maah ho

do they also murder innocents and then usurp their due
ubhra hua naqab men hai un ke ek taar

protruding from her veil I see, there is a thread awry
marta huun main ki ye na kisi ki nigah ho

I die of envy as I dread, 'tis someone's evil eye
jab mai-kada chhuTa to phir ab kya jagah ki qaid

when the tavern is no more, why bans should elsewhere be
masjid ho madrasa ho koi khanqah ho

be it mosque, madrasaa or else maybe monastery
sunte hain jo bahisht ki tarif sab durust

praises of paradise we hear are all true, I agree
lekin khuda kare vo tira jalva-gah ho

but I wish that God ordains, your parlour that it be
'ghalib' bhi gar na ho to kuchh aisa zarar nahin

if Gaalib's too no longer there, no loss would one obtain
duniya ho ya rab aur mira badshah ho

Lord, let the world exist and let my emperor remain
