hindu hain but-parast musalman khuda-parast
Hindu's pray to idols, God, Muslims venerate

pujun main us kisi ko jo ho ashna-parast
me, I worship any one / who prays to love's dictate

is daur men gai hai muravvat ki aankh phuuT
in this age are blinded / compassion, sympathy

madum hai jahan se chashm-e-haya-parast
people with a conscience / are difficult to see

dekha hai jab se rang-e-kafak tere paanv men
since the time they saw / soles of your feet tinged red

atish ko chhoá¸Œ gabr hue hain hina-parast
worshippers of fire / worship henna instead

chahe ki aks-e-dost rahe tujh men jalva-gar
if your loved one's image / within you want to see

aina-dar dil ko rakh apne safa-parast
the mirror of your heart / should worship purity

avargi se khush huun main itna ki bad-e-marg
I love gallivanting so / that even when I die

har zarra meri khaak ka hoga hava-parast
every speck of my dust will / in worship of wind's fly

khak-e-fana ko ta-ki parastish tu kar sake
juun khizr mat kahaiyo ab-e-baqa-parast

'sauda' se shakhs ke taiin azurda kijiye
a faithful one like 'sauda', you / consign to misery

ai khud-parast haif nahin tu vafa-parast
self-obsessed you are alas! no thought of loyalty
