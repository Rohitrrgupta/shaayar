ye na thi hamari qismat ki visal-e-yar hota
That my love be consummated, fate did not ordain

agar aur jiite rahte yahi intizar hota
Living longer had I waited, would have been in vain

tire vaade par jiye ham to ye jaan jhuuT jaana
that your promise made me live, let that not deceive

ki khushi se mar na jaate agar e'tibar hota
happily my life I'd give, If I could but believe

tiri nazuki se jaana ki bandha tha ahd boda
to your daintiness is tied, the frailty of your vow

kabhi tu na toá¸Œ sakta agar ustuvar hota
you couldn't break it if you tried, if it was firm somehow

koi mere dil se puchhe tire tir-e-nim-kash ko
what pain your arrow, partly drawn, inflicts upon my heart

ye khalish kahan se hoti jo jigar ke paar hota
cleanly through if it had gone, would it this sting impart

ye kahan ki dosti hai ki bane hain dost naseh
Say what friendship is this pray That friends seek to preach

koi charasaz hota koi gham-gusar hota
instead of trying to allay my pain with soothing speech

rag-e-sang se Tapakta vo lahu ki phir na thamta
blood would ooze from veins of stone, not stem nor ever tire

jise gham samajh rahe ho ye agar sharar hota
if what to us as grief is known, were but a spark of fire

gham agarche jan-gusil hai pa kahan bachen ki dil hai
If sorrow's fatal, then tell me, how can this heart endure

gham-e-ishq gar na hota gham-e-rozgar hota
if love's sorrow would not be, life's sorrow would, for sure

kahun kis se main ki kya hai shab-e-gham buri bala hai
of gloomy nights alone and sad, to whom should I complain

mujhe kya bura tha marna agar ek baar hota
Dying just once would not be bad, but each evening again

hue mar ke ham jo rusva hue kyuun na gharq-e-dariya
After death I was reviled, I would have rather drowned

na kabhi janaza uThta na kahin mazar hota
No remnant to be defiled, no grave site to be found

use kaun dekh sakta ki yagana hai vo yakta
Him how can anybody see, unique, no form, no face

jo dui ki bu bhi hoti to kahin do-char hota
were there a whiff of duality we'd see Him at some place

ye masail-e-tasavvuf ye tira bayan 'ghalib'
on mystic philosophy, Gaalib, your words profound

tujhe ham vali samajhte jo na bada-khvar hota
a saint we'd surely think you be, if drunken you weren't found
