nahin ishq men is ka to ranj hamen ki qarar o shakeb zara na raha
in love, I harbour no regret, peace, patience are nowhere

gham-e-ishq to apna rafiq raha koi aur bala se raha na raha
sorrow is still my intimate, if no one else, no care

diya apni khudi ko jo ham ne uTha vo jo parda sa biich men tha na raha
when I erased the self in me, the veil vanished between

rahe parde men ab na vo parda-nashin koi dusra us ke siva na raha
no longer was He shrouded then, save Him none else was seen

na thi haal ki jab hamen khabar rahe dekhte auron ke aib o hunar
as long unknowing of myself, in others faults did see

paḌi apni buraiyon par jo nazar to nigah men koi bura na raha
when my own faults I perceived, found none as bad as me

tire rukh ke khayal men kaun se din uThe mujh pe na fitna-e-roz-e-jaza
in thought of you, which day was not / like judgement day to me

tiri zulf ke dhyan men kaun si shab mire sar pe hujum-e-bala na raha
in contemplating curls, which night, not cause calamity

hamen saghar-e-bada ke dene men ab kare der jo saaqi to haae ghazab
in serving wine to me today, if she delays, alas!

ki ye ahd-e-nashat ye daur-e-tarab na rahega jahan men sada na raha
so transient, this age of youth, this time of joy shall pass

kai roz men aaj vo mehr-liqa hua mere jo samne jalva-numa
in ages does the moon-faced one / reveal herself to me

mujhe sabr o qarar zara na raha use pas-e-hijab-o-haya na raha
my calm, composure, I have lost, she, veiled timidity

tire khanjar o tegh ki ab-e-ravan hui jab ki sabil-e-sitam-zadgan
gae kitne hi qafile khushk-zaban koi tishna-e-ab-e-baqa na raha

mujhe saaf batae nigar agar to ye puchhun main ro ro ke khun-e-jigar
your soles have wiped whose tearful eyes your henna's washed away

male paanv se kis ke hain dida-e-tar kaf-e-pa pe jo rang-e-hina na raha
with tears of blood I'd ask of her, if truthfully she'd say

use chaha tha main ne ki rok rakhun miri jaan bhi jaae to jaane na duun
at risk even to life, I wished, to stop her going away

kiye laakh fareb karoḌ fusun na raha na raha na raha na raha
and though I played a million tricks, she did not, did not stay

lage yuun to hazaron hi tir-e-sitam ki taḌapte rahe paḌe khaak pe ham
though pierced by thousand darts of pain, in dust, writhing did remain

vale naaz o karishma ki tegh-e-do-dam lagi aisi ki tasma laga na raha
but twin-edged sword of airs and grace, slashed at me and I was slain

'zafar' aadmi us ko na janiyega vo ho kaisa hi sahab-e-fahm-o-zaka
deem him not a man though just / and wise he may appear

jise aish men yad-e-khuda na rahi jise taish men khauf-e-khuda na raha
in pleasure who forgets the Lord, in anger does not fear
