hazaron khvahishen aisi ki har khvahish pe dam nikle
I have a thousand yearnings , each one afflicts me so

bahut nikle mire arman lekin phir bhi kam nikle
Many were fulfilled for sure, not enough although

Dare kyuun mera qatil kya rahega us ki gardan par
Why is my murderer afraid would she have to account

vo khuun jo chashm-e-tar se umr bhar yuun dam-ba-dam nikle
For blood that ceaselessly, from these eyes does flow

nikalna khuld se aadam ka sunte aae hain lekin
From Eden, of Adam's exile, I am familiar, though

bahut be-abru ho kar tire kuche se ham nikle
Greatly humiliated from your street didI have to go

bharam khul jaae zalim tere qamat ki darazi ka
O cruel one, illusions of your stature all will know

agar is turra-e-pur-pech-o-kham ka pech-o-kham nikle
If those devious curls of yours could straighten arow

magar likhvae koi us ko khat to ham se likhvae
If someone wants to write to her, on me this task bestow

hui subh aur ghar se kaan par rakh kar qalam nikle
Since morning I am roaming with a pen upon my brow

hui is daur men mansub mujh se bada-ashami
The rites of drinking at this time with me associate

phir aaya vo zamana jo jahan men jam-e-jam nikle
Days are here now again when Jamshed's wine does flow

hui jin se tavaqqo' khastagi ki daad paane ki
For my injuries, from those that, praise I did expect

vo ham se bhi ziyada khasta-e-tegh-e-sitam nikle
They too turned out to be wounded, actually more so

mohabbat men nahin hai farq jiine aur marne ka
In love there is no difference 'tween life and death do know

usi ko dekh kar jiite hain jis kafir pe dam nikle
The very one for whom I die, life too does bestow

kahan mai-khane ka darvaza 'ghalib' aur kahan vaaiz
Wherefrom the 'saintly' priest, and where the tavern's door

par itna jante hain kal vo jaata tha ki ham nikle
But as I entered he was leaving, this much I do know
