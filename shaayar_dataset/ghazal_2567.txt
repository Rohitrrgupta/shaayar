zikr us pari-vash ka aur phir bayan apna
the splendour of her beauty and the manner I narrate

ban gaya raqib akhir tha jo raz-dan apna
so my rival he's become, who was my confidant to date

mai vo kyuun bahut piite bazm-e-ghair men ya rab
why in my rival's company, does she drink to excess

aaj hi hua manzur un ko imtihan apna
why today her prowess does she choose to demonstrate

manzar ik bulandi par aur ham bana sakte
if I only had possessed a home beyond the sky

arsh se udhar hota kaash ke makan apna
a spectacle at greater heights I could then create

de vo jis qadar zillat ham hansi men Talenge
it turns out that her sentry is closely known to me

baare ashna nikla un ka pasban apna
I'll laugh it off, however he may humiliate

dard-e-dil likhun kab tak jaun un ko dikhla duun
I would rather show to her, than write to her my pain

ungliyan figar apni khama khun-chakan apna
bloodied is my pen, and fingers, in a wounded state

ghiste ghiste miT jaata aap ne abas badla
It would have vanished itself by rubbing of my brow

nang-e-sajda se mere sang-e-astan apna
you have needlessly replaced the stone upon your gate

ta kare na ghammazi kar liya hai dushman ko
to stop his bearing tales to her my rival I've suborned

dost ki shikayat men ham ne ham-zaban apna
in one voice, against our love, we both remonstrate

ham kahan ke daana the kis hunar men yakta the
when was I wise in any way, had any skills unique

be-sabab hua 'ghalib' dushman asman apna
for no reason, Gaalib, heaven's hostile to my fate
