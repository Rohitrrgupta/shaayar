faqirana aae sada kar chale
I came chanting as a mendicant

ki myaan khush raho ham dua kar chale
and bestowed a blessing, be content

jo tujh bin na jiine ko kahte the ham
I will not live without you, I did say

so is ahd ko ab vafa kar chale
lo, now I fulfill that vow today

shifa apni taqdir hi men na thi
no cure was there in my fate's intent

ki maqdur tak to dava kar chale
even gifted healers tried and went

in the end such tasks did there present
ki na-char yuun ji jala kar chale

helpless and heartbroken that I went
vo kya chiiz hai aah jis ke liye

pray, what object was it, for whose sake
har ik chiiz se dil uTha kar chale

everything my heart chose to forsake
lest I might cast a despairing glance

so tum ham se munh bhi chhupa kar chale
you passed by me looking askance

bahut aarzu thi gali ki tiri
In your lane Oh! how I wished to stay

so yaan se lahu men naha kar chale
so there, bathed in blood, I made my way

dikhai diye yuun ki be-khud kiya
self-forgetful your sight made me be

hamen aap se bhi juda kar chale
from my very self you parted me

jabin sajda karte hi karte gai
head bowed, constantly, without a fuss

haq-e-bandagi ham ada kar chale
call of love's worship was answered thus

parastish ki yaan tak ki ai but tujhe
I worshipped you, Idol, to such degree

nazar men sabhon ki khuda kar chale
that You, as God, would every person see

jhaḌe phuul jis rang gulbun se yuun
flowers strewn in every shape and hue

chaman men jahan ke ham aa kar chale
in life's garden as I did pass through

na dekha gham-e-dostan shukr hai
I never saw the pain of friends, thanks be!

hamin daagh apna dikha kar chale
displayed my scars, passed on quietly

life I spent in thoughts of poetry
so is fan ko aisa baḌa kar chale

and raised this art to such degree
kahen kya jo puchhe koi ham se 'mir'

what did you do miir in your earthly stay
jahan men tum aae the kya kar chale

if I were asked, what can I ever say
