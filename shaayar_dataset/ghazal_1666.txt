taskin ko ham na roen jo zauq-e-nazar mile
I would not cry for comfort if pleasured be these eyes

huran-e-khuld men tiri surat magar mile
By semblance of your face amidst, virgins of paradise

apni gali men mujh ko na kar dafn bad-e-qatl
In your street, do not inter me, when I cease to be

mere pate se khalq ko kyuun tera ghar mile
Why should people find your house when they look for me

saqi-gari ki sharm karo aaj varna ham
Tis proper as a host that you should serve me generously

har shab piya hi karte hain mai jis qadar mile
Else I am used to drink each night however served to me

tujh se to kuchh kalam nahin lekin ai nadim
I grudge you not the messenger you chose to recommend

mera salam kahiyo agar nama-bar mile
found again say hello from me friend

tum ko bhi ham dikhaen ki majnun ne kya kiya
I could show to you as well, what was that majnuun did

fursat kashakash-e-gham-e-pinhan se gar mile
If I get leave to do so from my sorrows that are hid

lazim nahin ki khizr ki ham pairvi karen
To follow Khizr's directions is incumbent not on me

jaana ki ik buzurg hamen ham-safar mile
Just another elderly co-traveller he be

You should tend to him O dweller's of my lover's lane
tum ko kahin jo 'ghalib'-e-ashufta-sar mile

If you ever run into distressed Gaalib again
