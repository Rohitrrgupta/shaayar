vo aa ke khvab men taskin-e-iztirab to de
in my dreams, she would appear, perhaps, to give respite

vale mujhe tapish-e-dil majal-e-khvab to de
but first, my heartache should allow me to sleep at night

kare hai qatl lagavaT men tera ro dena
your weeping at my teasing you, stabs me thru the heart

tiri tarah koi tegh-e-nigah ko aab to de
none other can, save you, such edge, to dagger eyes impart

dikha ke jumbish-e-lab hi tamam kar ham ko
with just the sight of moving lips, kill me, let me die

na de jo bosa to munh se kahin javab to de
if you don't kiss me with your lips, do at least reply

pila de ok se saaqi jo ham se nafrat hai
if you despise me pour into my cupped palms, it is fine

piyala gar nahin deta na de sharab to de
give me not a glass but then, at least do give me wine

'asad' khushi se mire haath paanv phuul gae
with joyous rapture all my limbs, were rendered immobile

kaha jo us ne zara mere paanv daab to de
when she said to me do come, and press my feet awhile

ye kaun kahve hai abad kar hamen lekin
kabhi zamana murad-e-dil-e-kharab to de
