hans ke farmate hain vo dekh ke halat meri
seeing my condition, she laughs and asks of me

kyuun tum asan samajhte the mohabbat meri
Easy did you then imagine, loving me would be

baad marne ke bhi chhoá¸Œi na rifaqat meri
long even after death my love for her remains with me

meri turbat se lagi baiThi hai hasrat meri
my longing stays back clinging to my grave expectantly

main ne aghosh-e-tasavvur men bhi khencha to kaha
tho even in my thoughts when I embraced her lovingly

pis gai pis gai bedard nazakat meri
she complained you beast - you do bruise me brutally!

aina subh-e-shab-e-vasl jo dekha to kaha
when morn, after a night of bliss,the mirror she did see

dekh zalim ye thi shaam ko surat meri
said brute look at my state, tis now beyond propriety

yaar pahlu men hai tanhai hai kah do nikle
bid them to emerge, for she sits close right next to me

aaj kyuun dil men chhupi baiThi hai hasrat meri
why in my heart do my desires hide so bashfully

husn aur ishq ham-aghosh nazar aa jaate
the lover and beloved would entwined appear to be

teri tasvir men khinch jaati jo hairat meri
if in your picture could be drawn my wonder there to see

kis DhiTai se vo dil chhin ke kahte hain 'amir'
tugging at my heart with force she says this stubbornly

vo mira ghar hai rahe jis men mohabbat meri
the house wherein my love resides, is now my property
