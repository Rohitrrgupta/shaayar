main unhen chheá¸Œun aur kuchh na kahen
I tease her and she is tight lippped

chal nikalte jo mai piye hote
she would reply if wine she'd sipped

qahr ho ya bala ho jo kuchh ho
trouble torment what you be

kaash ke tum mire liye hote
If only you were made for me

meri qismat men gham gar itna tha
if so much pain my fate ordained

dil bhi ya-rab kai diye hote
I, many hearts should have obtained

aa hi jaata vo raah par 'ghalib'
she would have come to your ways

koi din aur bhi jiye hote
if you had lived a few more days
