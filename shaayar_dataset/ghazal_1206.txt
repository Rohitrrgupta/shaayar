rone se aur ishq men bebak ho gae
in love, bolder I became, once openly I cried

dhoe gae ham itne ki bas paak ho gae
I was washed so thoroughly that I got sanctified

to make payment for my wine, I sold my drinking gear
the ye hi do hisab so yuun paak ho gae

just these two burdens I had, thus I managed to clear
rusva-e-dahr go hue avargi se tum

your waywardness was the cause for your notriety
baare tabiaton ke to chalak ho gae

shrewd you did become although, temperamentally
kahta hai kaun nala-e-bulbul ko be-asar

who says the plaints of nightingales are to no avail
parde men gul ke laakh jigar chaak ho gae

a million hearts of roses are rent behind the veil
puchhe hai kya vajud o adam ahl-e-shauq ka

what of being and nothingness of lovers you inquire
aap apni aag ke khas-o-khashak ho gae

they have burnt like leaves and straw in heat of their desire
karne gae the us se taghaful ka ham gila

I had gone there to complain about her unconcern
ki ek hi nigah ki bas khaak ho gae

just a glance she cast on me, to ashes did I turn
is rang se uThai kal us ne 'asad' ki naash

in such a style my coffin, she carried yesterday
dushman bhi jis ko dekh ke ghamnak ho gae

seeing which e'en enemies of mine were caused dismay
