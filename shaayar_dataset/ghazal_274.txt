dil-bastagi si hai kisi zulf-e-duta ke saath
enmeshed with braided tresses my heart appears to be

paala paḌa hai ham ko khuda kis bala ke saath
tell me O Lord I am now faced with what calamity

kab tak nibhaiye but-e-na-ashna ke saath
how long should I care for her who does not care for me

kiije vafa kahan talak us bevafa ke saath
how far should I be faithful when she lacks fidelity

yad-e-hava-e-yar ne kya kya na gul khilae
what poignant passion was inflamed, then by her memories

aai chaman se nikhat-e-gul jab saba ke saath
when the fragrance of the flower came floating on the breeze

manga karenge ab se dua hijr-e-yar ki
to be parted from my dearest I will pray now hence

akhir to dushmani hai asar ko dua ke saath
as after all prayers bear enmity with consequence

hai kis ka intizar ki khvab-e-adam se bhi
who is it pray, whom I await even in death's embrace

har baar chaunk paḌte hain avaz-e-pa ke saath
that startles me each time I hear the sound of any pace

ya rab visal-e-yar men kyunkar ho zindagi
O Lord! in meetings with my lover how do I survive

nikli hi jaan jaati hai har har ada ke saath
her grace and charm and loveliness, don't let me stay alive

allah re soz-e-atish-e-gham ba'd-e-marg bhi
how strong does sorrow's fire burn, O Lord, despite my death

uThte hain meri khaak se sho'le hava ke saath
new flames in my ashes ignite, with every zephyr's breath

sau zindagi nisar karun aisi maut par
A hundred lifetimes I'd forsake and such a death receive

yuun roe zaar zaar tu ahl-e-aza ke saath
if you sit weeping copiously among the rest who grieve

har dam araq araq nigah-e-be-hijab hai
my eyes, uncovered, are now

bathed all the time in sweat
kis ne nigah-e-garm se dekha haya ke saath

who has cast a glance so coy yet warm and passionate
marne ke baa'd bhi vahi avargi rahi

this wanderlust remained the same, even after death
afsos jaan gai nafas-e-na-rasa ke saath

alas my life too went along with my ill-fated breath
dast-e-junun ne mera gareban samajh liya

the hand of my insanity thought it was my cape
uljha hai un se shokh ke band-e-qaba ke saath

and got entangled by mistake, with sashes of her drape
aate hi tere chal diye sab varna yaas ka

as soon as you arrived the crowds of despair did depart
kaisa hujum tha dil-e-hasrat-faza ke saath

else what a throng surrounded the yearnings of my heart
main kiine se bhi khush huun ki sab ye to kahte hain

I'm happy e'en with cruelty, as all do now agree
us fitna-gar ko laag hai is mubtala ke saath

the devastating beauty loves a distressed man like me
allah ri gumrahi but o but-khana chhoḌ kar

O Lord!! momin's lost his way, from idols does he flee
'momin' chala hai ka'ba ko ik parsa ke saath

and towards the mosque proceeds, in pious company
'momin' vahi ghazal paḌho shab jis se bazm men

aati thi lab pe jaan zah-o-habbaza ke saath
