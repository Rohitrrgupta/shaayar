ranjish hi sahi dil hi dukhane ke liye aa
even if you are annoyed come just to give me pain

aa phir se mujhe chhoá¸Œ ke jaane ke liye aa
come even if you have to then leave me yet again

kuchh to mire pindar-e-mohabbat ka bharam rakh
the notion of my love's self-pride please do pacify

tu bhi to kabhi mujh ko manane ke liye aa
you should surely come one day and try to mollify

pahle se marasim na sahi phir bhi kabhi to
even tho no longer close we are as used to be

rasm-o-rah-e-duniya hi nibhane ke liye aa
come even if it's purely for sake of formality

kis kis ko bataenge judai ka sabab ham
the reason for our parting to whom should I relate

tu mujh se khafa hai to zamane ke liye aa
if cross with methen come and to the world narrate

ik umr se huun lazzat-e-girya se bhi mahrum
a lifetime have I missed the joy of tearful ecstasy

ai rahat-e-jan mujh ko rulane ke liye aa
life's comfort thus to make me cry, you should come to me

ab tak dil-e-khush-fahm ko tujh se hain umiden
my heart is optimistic yet, its hopes are still alive

ye akhiri sham'en bhi bujhane ke liye aa
come to snuff it out, let not this final flame survive
