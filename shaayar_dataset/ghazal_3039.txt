vada-e-vaslat se dil ho shaad kya
why should vows of union now enthuse

tum se dushman ki mubarakbad kya
compliments from foes like you, what use

kuchh qafas men in dinon lagta hai ji
being caged now-a-days is easeful rest

ashiyan apna hua barbad kya
is it that someone has destroyed my nest

nala-e-paiham se yaan fursat nahin
there is no leisure from constant lament

O preacher what account can I present
hain asiir us ke jo hai apna asiir

when imprisoned by my prisoner then
ham na samjhe said kya sayyad kya

who is captor, captive's hard to ken
shokh-bazari thi shirin bhi magar

nashsha-e-ulfat se bhule yaar ko
love's headiness made me forget her too

sach hai aisi be-khudi men yaad kya
in stupor nought can one recall it's true

naala ik dam men uḌa Daale dhuen
a plaintive cry of mine will vaporize

charkh kya aur charkh ki buniyad kya
the very foundations of lofty skies

jab mujhe ranj-e-dil-azari na ho
torture's not a source of pain to me

O faithless one why then this cruelty
paanv tak pahunchi vo zulf-e-kham-ba-kham

curling tresses reach her feet you see
sarv ko ab bandhiye azad kya

can the cypress now held to be free
kya karun allah sab hain be-asar

Lord! what can I do Of no avail
valvala kya naala kya fariyad kya

is to weep or vent or even wail
in nasibon par kiya akhtar-shanas

just in counting stars my life is spent
asman bhi hai sitam-ijad kya

what tortures these cruel skies invent
roz-e-mahshar ki tavaqqo hai abas

futile is the hope for judgement day
aisi baton se ho khatir shaad kya

such talk won't raise my spirits any way
but-kada jannat hai chaliye be-hiras

the idol's house is heaven, come don’t fret
lab pe 'momin' harche bada-bad kya

whatever be Momin, there's nothing to regret
