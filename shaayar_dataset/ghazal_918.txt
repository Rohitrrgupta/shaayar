aadmi aadmi se milta hai
People meet each other, fairly frequently

dil magar kam kisi se milta hai
But, meeting of hearts, seldom does one see

bhuul jaata huun main sitam us ke
I manage to forget - all her acts of cruelty

vo kuchh is sadgi se milta hai
When she comes to meet me, with such humility

aaj kya baat hai ki phulon ka
What is that today- what can the reason be

rang teri hansi se milta hai
The flower's hue resembles, your smile so faithfully

teri khush-qamati se milta hai
mil ke bhi jo kabhi nahin milta

She who is mine and yet never mine will be
TuuT kar dil usi se milta hai

With only her this broken heart vests enternally
The rigours of this world, will find facility

hosh jab be-khudi se milta hai
When consciousness and stupor, are in unity

ruuh ko bhi maza mohabbat ka
To cherish love's rapture, the soul's ability

dil ki ham-saegi se milta hai
Exists as the heart resides in such proximity
