patta patta buuTa buuTa haal hamara jaane hai
only the flower's unaware, rest of the garden knows

jaane na jaane gul hi na jaane baagh to saara jaane hai
my state,each leaf and every bud that in the garden grows

lagne na de bas ho to us ke gauhar-e-gosh ko baale tak
now if it can, her pearldrops from being strung, it will prevent

us ko falak chashm-e-mah-o-khur ki putli ka taara jaane hai
stars in the eyes of sun and moon they're in heaven's intent

aage us mutakabbir ke ham khuda khuda kiya karte hain
against her supreme arrogance, God's name is no reprieve

kab maujud khuda ko vo maghrur-e-khud-ara jaane hai
she, being so vain and self absorbed, in God does not believe

ashiq sa to saada koi aur na hoga duniya men
as foolish as a lover in this world there would be none

ji ke ziyan ko ishq men us ke apna vaara jaane hai
in love although his life's forfeit he thinks that he has won

charagari bimari-e-dil ki rasm-e-shahr-e-husn nahin
healing hearts is not the wont of where these beauties stay

varna dilbar-e-nadan bhi is dard ka chara jaane hai
or my beloved, naive although, too can this ache allay

kya hi shikar-farebi par maghrur hai vo sayyad bacha
see how the child captor is proud at hoodwinking her prey

taair uá¸Œte hava men saare apne asara jaane hai
deems all those birds her prisoners that in the sky array

mehr o vafa o lutf-o-inayat ek se vaqif in men nahin
kindness, faith, favor or mercy none with her agree

aur to sab kuchh tanz o kinaya ramz o ishara jaane hai
though she is acquainted with all forms of coquetry

kya kya fitne sar par us ke laata hai mashuq apna
what forms of mischief on his head does my beloved rain!

jis be-dil be-tab-o-tavan ko ishq ka maara jaane hai
if someone, frail and wan, she thinks to be a hapless swain

rakhnon se divar-e-chaman ke munh ko le hai chhupa ya'ni
from the garden wall's recesses she keeps her face away

in surakhon ke Tuk rahne ko sau ka nazara jaane hai
as she believes her charms will then be on public display

tishna-e-khun hai apna kitna 'mir' bhi nadan talkhi-kash
how thirsty for his own blood miir that innocent man seems

dam-dar ab-e-tegh ko us ke ab-e-gavara jaane hai
that shimmer of the sharpened sword, sweet water he deems
