be-e'tidaliyon se subuk sab men ham hue
intemperance reduced my stature midst of company

jitne ziyada ho gae utne hi kam hue
the more excess I perpetrated, less I seemed to be

pinhan tha daam sakht qarib ashiyan ke
the net was laid concealed so very close there to my nest

uḌne na paae the ki giraftar ham hue
not even had started to fly that came under arrest

hasti hamari apni fana par dalil hai
my own life is a testament to my mortality

yaan tak miTe ki aap ham apni qasam hue
to this extent was I erased, myself I swear on me

sakhti kashan-e-ishq ki puchhe hai kya khabar
what do you ask of people those, that in love hardships bear

vo log rafta rafta sarapa alam hue
they, by degrees from head to toe, as grief themselves appear

teri vafa se kya ho talafi ki dahr men
me, in this world, your constancy, what compense can provide

tere siva bhi ham pe bahut se sitam hue
for, on me, many cruelties are present, yours aside

likhte rahe junun ki hikayat-e-khun-chakan
I kept on writing bleeding tales of madness undeterred

har-chand is men haath hamare qalam hue
even though in this exercise my hands were then severed

allah re teri tundi-e-khu jis ke biim se
O lord your fierceness is such, that in it's very dread

ajza-e-nala dil men mire rizq-e-ham hue
ingredients of heart's complaints, upon themselves all fed

ahl-e-havas ki fath hai tark-e-nabard-e-ishq
in giving up the war of love, is lover's victory

jo paanv uTh gae vahi un ke alam hue
because those feet that turn away, their standards seem to be

naale adam men chand hamare supurd the
a few plaints were entrusted me, ere time of life and death

jo vaan na khinch sake so vo yaan aa ke dam hue
those there I couldn't draw upon, I draw them here as breath

chhoḌi 'asad' na ham ne gadai men dil-lagi
Asad romance could not forswear, e'en when a mendicant

saail hue to ashiq-e-ahl-e-karam hue
began loving the generous ones, when turned a supplicant
