dekhna qismat ki aap apne pe rashk aa jaae hai
just see my fate, that of myself, how envious I be

main use dekhun bhala kab mujh se dekha jaae hai
that even I may look at her, when can I bear to see

haath dho dil se yahi garmi gar andeshe men hai
write off your heart if there within heat of suspicion be

abgina tundi-e-sahba se pighla jaae hai
the crystal flask will melt due to the wine's strong potency

ghair ko ya rab vo kyunkar mana-e-gustakhi kare
my rival, how can she restrain, from taking liberty

gar haya bhi us ko aati hai to sharma jaae hai
as when she gets abashed she is, struck by timidity

shauq ko ye lat ki har dam naala khinche jaiye
desires are addicted to sighing with each intake

dil ki vo halat ki dam lene se ghabra jaae hai
but at the thought of drawing breath my heart begins to quake

duur chashm-e-bad tiri bazm-e-tarab se vaah vaah
far, may the evil eye be from your joy-filled company

naghma ho jaata hai vaan gar naala mera jaae hai
for, when my plaintive cry goes there, becomes a melody

forgetfulness might serve to screen, secrets of love somehow
par ham aise khoe jaate hain ki vo pa jaae hai

but I get lost in such a way, that she then gets to know
us ki bazm-araiyan sun kar dil-e-ranjur yaan

news of her gilded gathering, here makes this mourful heart
sink, just the way, into her heart, as sinks my rival's dart

ho ke ashiq vo pari-rukh aur nazuk ban gaya
herself in love, the fairy face, more delicate does seem

rang khulta jaae hai jitna ki uá¸Œta jaae hai
the more her colour drains more so, does her complexion gleam

naqsh ko us ke musavvir par bhi kya kya naaz hain
whay games of coyness does her painting with the painter play

khinchta hai jis qadar utna hi khinchta jaae hai
as much as he attemtps to draw, it draws further away

saaya mera mujh se misl-e-dud bhage hai 'asad'
from me my shadow just like smoke, seems now to fly away

paas mujh atish-ba-jan ke kis se Thahra jaae hai
for near a flaming soul as me, who could then bear to stay
