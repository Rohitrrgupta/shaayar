koi ummid bar nahin aati
no hope is there that now comes to light

koi surat nazar nahin aati
nor is there any avenue in sight

maut ka ek din muayyan hai
when for death a day has been ordained

niind kyuun raat bhar nahin aati
what reason that I cannot sleep all night

aage aati thi hal-e-dil pe hansi
nothing now could even make me smile,

ab kisi baat par nahin aati
I once could laugh at my heart's own plight

virtues of restraint and prayer I know
par tabiat idhar nahin aati

but neither do my temperament excite
hai kuchh aisi hi baat jo chup huun

Do you think I know not how to speak
varna kya baat kar nahin aati

There's something- my tongue I have to bite
kyuun na chikhun ki yaad karte hain

when absence of my voice makes her pine
meri avaz gar nahin aati

why then should I not shout with all my might
dagh-e-dil gar nazar nahin aata

O healer does not any smell persist
bu bhi ai chara-gar nahin aati

if burning scars of heart are not in sight
ham vahan hain jahan se ham ko bhi

I'm at a place from where no news of me
kuchh hamari khabar nahin aati

now even to myself can come to light
marte hain aarzu men marne ki

I die yearning as I hope for death
maut aati hai par nahin aati

Death does come to me but then not quite
ka'ba kis munh se jaoge 'ghalib'

Ghalib,what face will you to the kaabaa take
sharm tum ko magar nahin aati

when you are not ashamed and not contrite
