kisi ko de ke dil koi nava-sanj-e-fughan kyuun ho
Having parted with ones heart why should one cry in pain

na ho jab dil hi siine men to phir munh men zaban kyuun ho
When the heart is missing why should one's voice remain

vo apni khu na chhoḌenge ham apni vaza kyuun chhoḌen
She will not leave her wont then why should I differently behave

subuk-sar ban ke kya puchhen ki ham se sargiran kyuun ho
Why should I abase myself and cringingly her favours crave

kiya gham-khvar ne rusva lage aag is mohabbat ko
Rather than console, aspersed, such friendship is in vain

na laave taab jo gham ki vo mera raz-dan kyuun ho
Why be my confidante when he cannot soothe my pain

vafa kaisi kahan ka ishq jab sar phoḌna Thahra
Whence love, what romance, if one, has to break one's head

to phir ai sang-dil tera hi sang-e-astan kyuun ho
Then heartless one, why only on, the stone beneath your tread

qafas men mujh se rudad-e-chaman kahte na Dar hamdam
In prison do not shirk from telling me the garden's plight

giri hai jis pe kal bijli vo mera ashiyan kyuun ho
Why should it only be my nest where lightning struck last night

ye kah sakte ho ham dil men nahin hain par ye batlao
Tho you may say that I've no place in your heart, but you

ki jab dil men tumhin tum ho to ankhon se nihan kyuun ho
And only you are in my heart then why hidden from view

ghalat hai jazb-e-dil ka shikva dekho jurm kis ka hai
Whose fault is it on my emotions, you harp wrongfully

na khincho gar tum apne ko kashakash darmiyan kyuun ho
If you don't pull away from me, why should this struggle be

ye fitna aadmi ki khana-virani ko kya kam hai
Is this trouble not enough, to ruin one what else should be

hue tum dost jis ke dushman us ka asman kyuun ho
If you are someone's friend then why needs heaven be his enemy

yahi hai azmana to satana kis ko kahte hain
If this a trial, test, then pray what is torment please explain

adu ke ho liye jab tum to mera imtihan kyuun ho
You've chosen my rival now, what need to test and cause me pain

kaha tum ne ki kyuun ho ghair ke milne men rusvai
You said there's no disgrace in meeting with my rival then

baja kahte ho sach kahte ho phir kahiyo ki haan kyuun ho
You are right, you speak the truth, repeat

nikala chahta hai kaam kya taanon se tu 'ghalib'
What will you attain with taunts, Gaalib, do tell me

tire be-mehr kahne se vo tujh par mehrban kyuun ho
If merciless you call her why should merciful she be
