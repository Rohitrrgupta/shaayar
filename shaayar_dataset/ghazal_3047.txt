adam men rahte to shaad rahte use bhi fikr-e-sitam na hota
If I had been in nothingness, my heart would not complain

jo ham na hote to dil na hota jo dil na hota to gham na hota
were I not here, there'd be no heart and with no heart no pain

hui khajalat se nafrat afzun gile kiye khuub akhirin dam
her hatred rose when her complaints shamed me so close to death

vo kaash ik dam Thahar ke aate ki mere lab par bhi dam na hota
if only she would have delayed, there would have been no breath

paḌa hi marna bas ab to ham ko jo us ne khat paḌh ke nama-bar se
I have to die now, as she bids the messenger explain

kaha ki gar sach ye haal hota to daftar itna raqam na hota
how could he pen such lengthy tomes if was truly in pain

kisi ke jalne ka dhyan aaya vagarna dud-e-fughan se mere
you thought of someone else's pain, else smoke of my lament

agar hazaron sipehr bante tumhari ankhon men nam na hota
would not bring tears to your eyes, however dense it went

jo aap dar se uTha na dete kahin na karta main jabha-sai
had you not bid me rise and leave, I wouldn't bow elsewhere

agarche ye sarnavisht men tha tumhare sar ki qasam na hota
if even were my destiny, it would not be I swear

visal ko ham taras rahe the jo ab hua to maza na paaya
when union, that I yearned for, came, no pleasure I received

adu ke marne ki jab khushi thi ki us ko ranj-o-alam na hota
I would be glad at my foe's death, if only she'd not grieved

jahan-e-tang o hujum-e-vahshat gharaz ki dam par buri bani thi
constriction of this world and throngs of frenzy caused me grief

kahan main jaata na ji Thaharta kahin jo dasht-e-adam na hota
weren't it for wilderness of death where would I find relief

magar raqibon ne sar uThaya ki ye na hota to be-muravvat
perchance my rivals stared at her, for else, in no event

nazar se zahir haya na hoti haya se gardan men kham na hota
would coyness in her eyes appear, or would her neck be bent

vahan taraqqi jamal ko hai yahan mohabbat hai roz-afzun
there beauty does ever increase, here love does daily grow

sharik-e-zeba tha bul-havas bhi jo bevafai men kam na hota
the lecher faithless in intent, does bathe too in her glow

ghalat ki sane' ko ho gavara kharash-e-angusht-ha-e-nazuk
The Maker too would not accept her dainty finger bruised

javab-e-khat ki umiid rakhte jo qaul-e-juffil-qalam na hota
Thus a response I didn’t expect, lest by a quill contused

ye be-takalluf phira rahi hai kashish dil-e-ashiqan ki us ko
attracted by her lover's heart, she roams without a care

vagarna aisi nazakaton pe khiram-e-naz ik qadam na hota
for else her feet so frail and soft, nary a step would dare

visal to hai kahan mayassar magar khayal-e-visal hi men
Where else could union be obtained except in reverie

maze uḌate havas nikalti jo saath andaz-e-ram na hota
in dreams desires I would sate, did she not coyly flee

hua musalman main aur Dar se na dars-e-vaiz ko sun ke 'momin'
Muslim Momin turned in fear , not on the priest's advice

bani thi dozakh bala se banti azab-e-hijr-e-sanam na hota
parting's pain I could not bear, of hell didn't care a trice
