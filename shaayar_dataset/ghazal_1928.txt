tu dost kasu ka bhi sitamgar na hua tha
O tyrant you could never be anybody's friend

auron pe hai vo zulm ki mujh par na hua tha
the tortures that on others are, on me don't attend

chhoá¸Œa mah-e-nakhshab ki tarah dast-e-qaza ne
like in the case NaKHshab's moon, fate gave up the fight

khurshid hunuz us ke barabar na hua tha
the sun was not yet equal to my beloved's light

taufiq ba-andaza-e-himmat hai azal se
through courage, Grace of God avails, since eternity

ankhon men hai vo qatra ki gauhar na hua tha
were it not a teardrop then, a bauble it would be

jab tak ki na dekha tha qad-e-yar ka aalam
until I had not espied, her stature gracefull tall

main mo'taqid-e-fitna-e-mahshar na hua tha
I did not believe in stories of doomsday at all

main sada-dil azurdagi-e-yar se khush huun
Simple hearted, I am happy that she is upset

yaani sabaq-e-shauq mukarrar na hua tha
it is as if earlier love's lesson I didn't get

dariya-e-maasi tunuk-abi se hua khushk
the sea of sinfulness depletes, it is nearly drained

mera sar-e-daman bhi abhi tar na hua tha
and yet the hemline of my vest, has barely been stained

jaari thi 'asad' dagh-e-jigar se miri tahsil
long before, these burning scars did then my heart adorn

atish-kada jagir-e-samundar na hua tha
ere even advent of salamanders fire-born
