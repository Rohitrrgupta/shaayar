dhota huun jab main piine ko us sim-tan ke paanv
when I wash the fair one's feet that water for to drink

rakhta hai zid se khinch ke bahar lagan ke paanv
she stubbornly snatches her feet right out of the sink

di sadgi se jaan paḌun kohkan ke paanv
for his innocence I'd go and fall at Kohkan's feet

haihat kyuun na TuuT gae pir-zan ke paanv
why, alas, an early end, did the crone not meet

bhage the ham bahut so usi ki saza hai ye
I'm punished in this manner as I tried to run away

ho kar asiir dabte hain rahzan ke paanv
I'm the robber's prisoner and press his feet today

marham ki justuju men phira huun jo duur duur
in search of salve I wander distances

tan se siva figar hain is khasta-tan ke paanv
my body was all injured, my feet too wounded are

Let my wanderlust be seen that even when I've gone
hilte hain khud-ba-khud mire andar kafan ke paanv

on their own accord my feet, entombed, yet journey on
hai josh-e-gul bahar men yaan tak ki har taraf

flowers are so frezied that, in springtime all around
uḌte hue ulajhte hain murgh-e-chaman ke paanv

tripping up while taking flight
birds are to be found

shab ko kisi ke khvab men aaya na ho kahin
at night, I hope she's not appeared in anybody's dreams

dukhte hain aaj us but-e-nazuk-badan ke paanv
feet of that idol, frail, fragile, ache today it seems

'ghalib' mire kalam men kyunkar maza na ho
Ghalib why should not my verse cause people to rejoice

piita huun dhoke khusrav-e-shirin-sukhan ke paanv
I drink the washings of the feet of Khusro, sweet of voice
