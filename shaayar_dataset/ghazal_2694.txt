dard se mere hai tujh ko be-qarari haae haae
now for my pain you feel the pangs of severe restlessness

kya hui zalim tiri ghaflat-shiari haae haae
O tyrant what has happened to your creed of callousness

tere dil men gar na tha ashob-e-gham ka hausla
if strength, your heart did not possess, this sorrow's storm to bide

tu ne phir kyuun ki thi meri gham-gusari haae haae
my sorrow, to console, alas, you should have never tried

kyuun miri gham-khvargi ka tujh ko aaya tha khayal
why did the thought of comforting me ever come to thee

dushmani apni thi meri dost-dari haae haae
in friendship with me you became, your own worst enemy

umr bhar ka tu ne paiman-e-vafa bandha to kya
what matter, lifelong faithfulness, to me you did profess

umr ko bhi to nahin hai paedari haae haae
alas eternal permanence, life too does not possess

zahr lagti hai mujhe ab-o-hava-e-zindagi
this life's environment appears, now poisonous to me

yaani tujh se thi ise na-sazgari haae haae
this for because unsuitable for you it proved to be

gul-fishani-ha-e-naz-e-jalva ko kya ho gaya
where are your flower-strewing grace and airs, I cannot see

khaak par hoti hai teri lala-kari haae haae
now on your dust do flowers bloom, alas my tragedy

sharm-e-rusvai se ja chhupna naqab-e-khak men
you from dishonour's shame to hide, in veil of dust concealed

khatm hai ulfat ki tujh par parda-dari haae haae
on you doth end the lesson how, love's modesty to shield

khaak men namus-e-paiman-e-mohabbat mil gai
the honor of your vows of love, to dust has been consigned

uTh gai duniya se rah-o-rasm-e-yari haae haae
love's creed and custom in this world, one will now never find

haath hi tegh-azma ka kaam se jaata raha
the hand that once did wield the sword, no longer is of use

dil pe ik lagne na paaya zakhm-e-kari haae haae
before a wound deep on my heart, it even did produce

kis tarah kaaTe koi shab-ha-e-tar-e-barshigal
these nights of sorrow dark and wet, how ever can I pass

hai nazar khu-karda-e-akhtar-shumari haae haae
inured to counting stars in wait, these eyes have been alas

ears of her messages deprived, eyes of her vision fair
ek dil tis par ye na-ummid-vari haae haae

one heart is all I have and slew of hopelesness, depair
ishq ne paká¸Œa na tha 'ghalib' abhi vahshat ka rang

my love had not yet reached the stage of sheer insanity
rah gaya tha dil men jo kuchh zauq-e-khvari haae haae

heart yearning unfulfilled remained, for union's ecstacy
