vo jo ham men tum men qarar tha tumhen yaad ho ki na yaad ho
the love that 'tween us used to be, you may, may not recall

vahi yaani vaada nibah ka tumhen yaad ho ki na yaad ho
those promises of constancy, you may, may not recall

vo jo lutf mujh pe the beshtar vo karam ki tha mire haal par
those favours that you did bestow, the kindness that you once did show

mujhe sab hai yaad zara zara tumhen yaad ho ki na yaad ho
I can recall them all somehow, you may, may not recall

vo nae gile vo shikayaten vo maze maze ki hikayaten
new complaints each every night,

stories so full of delight
vo har ek baat pe ruThna tumhen yaad ho ki na yaad ho

at every word your feigning slight, you may, may not recall
kabhi baiThe sab men jo ru-ba-ru to isharaton hi se guftugu

sitting in midst of company, talking in gestures openly
vo bayan shauq ka barmala tumhen yaad ho ki na yaad ho

that expression of love publicly, you may, may not recall
hue ittifaq se gar baham to vafa jatane ko dam-ba-dam

if face to face we chanced to be, to constantly prove loyalty
gila-e-malamat-e-aqriba tumhen yaad ho ki na yaad ho

those plaints of folks' rebukes to me, you may, may not recall
koi baat aisi agar hui ki tumhare ji ko buri lagi

a word of mine if were to be, which hurt you to any degree
to bayan se pahle hi bhulna tumhen yaad ho ki na yaad ho

forgetting it most instantly, you may, may not recall
kabhi ham men tum men bhi chaah thi kabhi ham se tum se bhi raah thi

friendship twixt us once used to be, a path there was from you to me
kabhi ham bhi tum bhi the ashna tumhen yaad ho ki na yaad ho

once I and you were not, but we, you may, may not recall
suno zikr hai kai saal ka ki kiya ik aap ne vaada tha

Long past though it appears to be,there was something you promised me
so nibahane ka to zikr kya tumhen yaad ho ki na yaad ho

to fulfil each vow truthfully, you may, may not recall
kaha main ne baat vo koThe ki mire dil se saaf utar gai

to kaha ki jaane miri bala tumhen yaad ho ki na yaad ho
vo bigaá¸Œna vasl ki raat ka vo na manna kisi baat ka

you getting angry when we met, at everything getting upset
vo nahin nahin ki har aan ada tumhen yaad ho ki na yaad ho

your nay saying I can't forget, you may, may not recall
jise aap ginte the ashna jise aap kahte the ba-vafa

the one you once held close to you, the one whom once you deemed as true
main vahi huun 'momin'-e-mubtala tumhen yaad ho ki na yaad ho

I am that distressed Momin, blue, you may, may not recall
