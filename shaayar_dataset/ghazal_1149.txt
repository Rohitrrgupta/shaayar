Thani thi dil men ab na milenge kisi se ham
I had resolved to meet no one ever again

par kya karen ki ho gae na-char ji se ham
my heart made me helpless and I could not refrain

hanste jo dekhte hain kisi ko kisi se ham
when I see people laugh amongst themselves I stare

munh dekh dekh rote hain kis be-kasi se ham
at their faces and shed tears in utter despair

ham se na bolo tum ise kya kahte hain bhala
whatever it be called, you do not have to say

insaf kiije puchhte hain aap hi se ham
I ask you for justice that's merely all I pray

be-zar jaan se jo na hote to mangte
if I were not disgusted with life I would have sought

shahid shikayaton pe tiri muddai se ham
My rival to bear witness against the plaints you brought

us ku men ja marenge madad ai hujum-e-shauq
O throng of my desires help me, in her street, to die

aaj aur zor karte hain be-taqati se ham
however weak my efforts be now harder I will try

sahab ne is ghulam ko azad kar diya
the master has now freed me from the yoke of slavery

lo bandagi ki chhuT gae bandagi se ham
see my worship that from bondage I have been set free

be-roe misl-e-abr na nikla ghubar-e-dil
Till I cried like clouds, my heart's delusions were all there

kahte the un ko barq-e-tabassum hansi se ham
Flippantly, her smile to lightning, I used to compare

in na-tavaniyon pe bhi the khar-e-rah-e-ghair
tho frail and weak, a thorn was I in my rival's way

kyuun kar nikale jaate na us ki gali se ham
why would I, then from her path, not be cast away

kya gul khilega dekhiye hai fasl-e-gul to duur
wait and see what happens, spring is not yet near

aur su-e-dasht bhagte hain kuchh abhi se ham
towards wilderness I flee, this early in the year

munh dekhne se pahle bhi kis din vo saaf tha
even ere my face I saw, when was it spotless, clean

be-vajh kyuun ghubar rakhen aarsi se ham
why should then a grudge we bear, against the mirror's sheen

hai chheá¸Œ ikhtilat bhi ghairon ke samne
her dalliance with my rival vexes me so deep

hansne ke badle roen na kyuun gudgudi se ham
when tickled, 'stead of laughing, why should I not weep

vahshat hai ishq-e-parda-nashin men dam-e-buka
munh Dhankte hain parda-e-chashm-e-pari se ham

kya dil ko le gaya koi begana-ashna
has my heart been taken by a stranger tell me pray

kyuun apne ji ko lagte hain kuchh ajnabi se ham
Why then am I a stranger to myself today

le naam aarzu ka to dil ko nikal len
if it even mentions hope the heart I will deface

'momin' na hon jo rabt rakhen bidati se ham
I'm not a true adherent if new tenets I embrace
