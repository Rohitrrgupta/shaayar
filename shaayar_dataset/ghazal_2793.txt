koi din gar zindagani aur hai
If, for a few days, longer life would be

apne ji men ham ne Thani aur hai
I am resolved to live it differently

atish-e-dozakh men ye garmi kahan
where can this heat be found in flames of hell

the heat of hidden sorrow's nonpareil
bar-ha dekhi hain un ki ranjishen

her anger oftentimes though I have seen
par kuchh ab ke sargirani aur hai

but this time round it is another scene
de ke khat munh dekhta hai nama-bar

the letter hands,yet stares the messenger
kuchh to paigham-e-zabani aur hai

some verbal message surely there's from her
to shorten lives the stars often conspire

her deadly form is something else entire
ho chukin 'ghalib' balaen sab tamam

now all calamities have come to pass
all that remains is sudden death alas
