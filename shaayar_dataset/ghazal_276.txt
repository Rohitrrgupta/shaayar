yaaro mujhe muaaf rakho main nashe men huun
pardon me my friends- I am in a drunken stupor

ab do to jaam khali hi do main nashe men huun
give me just an empty cup, now if you serve me more

ek ek qurt daur men yuun hi mujhe bhi do
just a drop or two in every round you should now pour

jam-e-sharab pur na karo main nashe men huun
fill not my goblet to the brim, I should drink no more

masti se darhami hai miri guftugu ke biich
drunkenness makes my speech incoherent today

jo chaho tum bhi mujh ko kaho main nashe men huun
As I'm not in my senses, say what you wish to say

ya hathon haath lo mujhe manind-e-jam-e-mai
either hold me by your hand as like a glass you would

ya thoḌi duur saath chalo main nashe men huun
or else walk with me

a while lest stumble, fall I should
maazur huun jo paanv mira be-tarah paḌe

I am helpless that my feet don't tread in a proper way
tum sargiran to mujh se na ho main nashe men huun

do not be annoyed with me I've had too much today
bhagi namaz-e-juma to jaati nahin hai kuchh

Friday prayers won't run away, they can surely wait
chalta huun main bhi Tuk to raho main nashe men huun

I shall come, hold on a while, I'm in a drunken state
nazuk-mizaj aap qayamat hain 'mir' ji

miirji the frailty of your temperament is truly such
juun shisha mere munh na lago main nashe men huun

brush not my lips like a cup for I've drunk too much
