bas-ki dushvar hai har kaam ka asan hona
Tis difficult that every goal be easily complete

aadmi ko bhi muyassar nahin insan hona
For a man, too, to be human, is no easy feat

girya chahe hai kharabi mire kashane ki
My tears seek destruction of my humble abode

dar o divar se Tapke hai bayaban hona
My hearth and home relentlessly does wilderness erode

vae-divangi-e-shauq ki har dam mujh ko
Such is desire's lunacy, I constantly repair

aap jaana udhar aur aap hi hairan hona
To her street, even tho it leads me to despair

jalva az-bas-ki taqaza-e-nigah karta hai
Beauty does yet seek behold the favour of a glance

jauhar-e-aina bhi chahe hai mizhgan hona
The lustre of the mirror seeks to be a lash perchance

Ask not the delight of those for martyrdom who wait
id-e-nazzara hai shamshir ka uryan hona

Unsheathing of the sword for them is cause to celebrate
le gae khaak men ham dagh-e-tamanna-e-nashat

With me into dust I took the scars of hopes forlorn
tu ho aur aap ba-sad-rang-e-gulistan hona

Now in your splendour joyously the garden you adorn
When the heart is wounded does its ecstacy exalt

Fortitude is filled with joy when wounds are dipped in salt
ki mire qatl ke baa'd us ne jafa se tauba

After she had slain me then from torture she forswore
haae us zud-pasheman ka pasheman hona

Alas! the one now quickly shamed was not so before
haif us chaar girah kapá¸Œe ki qismat 'ghalib'

Ghalib alas! That piece of cloth for whom destiny
jis ki qismat men ho ashiq ka gareban hona

Has ordained a fate that it, a lover's collar be
