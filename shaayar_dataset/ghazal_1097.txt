gai vo baat ki ho guftugu to kyunkar ho
gone is the time I used to think, how will I speak with you

kahe se kuchh na hua phir kaho to kyunkar ho
but talking did not help at all, now say what can I do

hamare zehn men us fikr ka hai naam visal
just union with my loved one is, now all that bothers me

ki gar na ho to kahan jaaen ho to kyunkar ho
where will I go were not to be, if were, how can it be

adab hai aur yahi kashmakash to kya kiije
what can I do, this dilemma, am bound by courtesy,

haya hai aur yahi gu-magu to kyunkar ho
when she is coy, reluctant too, how will love come to be

tumhin kaho ki guzara sanam-paraston ka
how will these idol-worshippers survive, you must comment

buton ki ho agar aisi hi khu to kyunkar ho
how can it ever be if idols have this temperament

ulajhte ho tum agar dekhte ho aina
you, at your own reflection in the mirror, take offense

jo tum se shahr men hon ek do to kyunkar ho
were more here, one or two like you, say what would happen thence

jise nasib ho roz-e-siyah mera sa
a person in whose destiny the days are dark and bleak

vo shakhs din na kahe raat ko to kyunkar ho
if night he does not deem as day, then what else would he speak

hamen phir un se ummid aur unhen hamari qadr
for me to harbour hope from her, for her to care for me

hamari baat hi puchhen na vo to kyunkar ho
if she won't even ask my will, how can these ever be

ghalat na tha hamen khat par guman tasalli ka
illusion of contentment by her letter may be true

na maane dida-e-didar jo to kyunkar ho
without her sight my eyes rebelled, what was it I could do

batao us mizha ko dekh kar ki mujh ko qarar
at seeing those eyelashes say, how peace and harmony

vo niish ho rag-e-jan men faro to kyunkar ho
if in life's vein, those knives embed, can ever come to me

mujhe junun nahin 'ghalib' vale ba-qaul-e-huzur
I am not frenzied Gaalib for, as says his majesty

firaq-e-yar men taskin ho to kyunkar ho
in parting from one's paramour, how peace can ever be
