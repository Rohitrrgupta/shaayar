na tha kuchh to khuda tha kuchh na hota to khuda hota
In nothingness God was there, if naught he would persist

Duboya mujh ko hone ne na hota main to kya hota
Existence has sunk me, what loss, if I did'nt exist

hua jab gham se yuun be-his to gham kya sar ke kaTne ka
When so burdenened, why the sorrow, of losing one's head

na hota gar juda tan se to zaanu par dhara hota
If it had not been severed, would be, hanging low instead

hui muddat ki 'ghalib' mar gaya par yaad aata hai
Though ages he's been dead Gaalib is, still thought of today

vo har ik baat par kahna ki yuun hota to kya hota
At every trice, to ask what would be, if it were this way
