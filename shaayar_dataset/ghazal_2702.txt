dil mira soz-e-nihan se be-muhaba jal gaya
in passion's hidden heat my heart, did choose to bravely burn

atish-e-khamosh ki manind goya jal gaya
like fire silent and unseen, to ashes it did turn

dil men zauq-e-vasl o yad-e-yar tak baaqi nahin
neither the yen for union nor her thoughts this heart retained

aag is ghar men lagi aisi ki jo tha jal gaya
for such a blaze consumed this house, burnt all that it contained

main adam se bhi pare huun varna ghafil bar-ha
Ye ignorant! beyond the state of nothingness I've turned

meri ah-e-atishin se bal-e-anqa jal gaya
else by my fiery sighs the feathers of the phoenix burned

arz kiije jauhar-e-andesha ki garmi kahan
my flaming intensity of thought to whom can I narrate

kuchh khayal aaya tha vahshat ka ki sahra jal gaya
just thinking of the desert caused, it to incinerate

dil nahin tujh ko dikhata varna daghon ki bahar
my heart's no more, my burning scars, else I would show to you

is charaghan ka karun kya kar-farma jal gaya
the lamp itself is charred now with , these lights what do I do

main huun aur afsurdagi ki aarzu 'ghalib' ki dil
now I exist alone just with hope of melancholy

dekh kar tarz-e-tapak-e-ahl-e-duniya jal gaya
because my heart is seared by people's insincerity

shoala-ru jab ho gae garm-e-tamasha jal gaya
ta kuja afsos-e-garmi-ha-e-sohbat ai khayal

hai 'asad' begana-e-afsurdagi ai bekasi
duud mera sumbulistan se kare hai ham-sari

bas-ki shauq-e-atish-e-gul se sarapa jal gaya
shama-ruyan ki sar-angusht-e-hinai dekh kar

ghuncha-e-gul par-fishan parvana-asa jal gaya
