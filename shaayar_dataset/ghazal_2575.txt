kyuun jal gaya na tab-e-rukh-e-yar dekh kar
why didn't I turn to ashes seeing her face so glowing, bright

jalta huun apni taqat-e-didar dekh kar
by envy now I am inflamed, at strength of my own sight

atish-parast kahte hain ahl-e-jahan mujhe
a worshipper of fire thus they all hold me to be

watching me spout fiery sighs of sorrow zealously
kya abru-e-ishq jahan aam ho jafa

what dignity in love would be, if torture's commonplace
rukta huun tum ko be-sabab azar dekh kar

I hesitate, you when I see, dispensing it apace
aata hai mere qatl ko par josh-e-rashk se

she comes to slay me but it is, the heat of jealousy
marta huun us ke haath men talvar dekh kar

which kills me when I see she holds the blade caressingly
sabit hua hai gardan-e-mina pe khun-e-khalq

the blood of innocents upon the flask's neck proved to be
larze hai mauj-e-mai tiri raftar dekh kar

wine quivers when it sees you float, intoxicatingly
va-hasrata ki yaar ne khincha sitam se haath

alas! that my beloved did from torture then refrain
ham ko haris-e-lazzat-e-azar dekh kar

when she beheld me craving for deliciousness of pain
bik jaate hain ham aap mata-e-sukhan ke saath

I can be sold alongside with my wares of poetry
if taste the buyes does possess and sensibility

zunnar bandh subha-e-sad-dana toḌ Daal
put on the holy thread and break the beaded rosary

rah-rau chale hai raah ko hamvar dekh kar
for travelers do take the path that smooth appears to be

in ablon se paanv ke ghabra gaya tha main
these blisters on my feet were cause of great concern to me

ji khush hua hai raah ko pur-khar dekh kar
but gladdened is my heart for thorns there in the path to see

kya bad-guman hai mujh se ki aine men mire
on peeping in my mirror how distrustful can she be

tuuti ka aks samjhe hai zangar dekh kar
thinks that the green patina is a parrot's effigy

girni thi ham pe barq-e-tajalli na tuur par
instead of falling on the mount, the bolt should have struck me

dete hain baada zarf-e-qadah-khvar dekh kar
for wine should be served as per the drinker's capacity

sar phoḌna vo 'ghalib'-e-shorida haal ka
his busting of his head those days, in state of lunacy

yaad aa gaya mujhe tiri divar dekh kar
now when I see you wall it all comes back to memory
