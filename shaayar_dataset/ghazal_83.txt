fariyad ki koi lai nahin hai
no tune is needed by a sigh

laments do not on flutes rely
kyuun bote hain baghban tonbe

why gourds do gardeners now plant
gar baagh gada-e-mai nahin hai

if wine, the garden does not want
har-chand har ek shai men tu hai

although in everything you be
par tujh si koi shai nahin hai

yet there is none who is like thee
by being be you not deceived

har-chand kahen ki hai nahin hai
is not however is believed

shadi se guzar ki gham na hove
if joy's eschewed, no grief at all

urdi jo na ho to dai nahin hai
if spring's not there, nor will be fall

kyuun radd-e-qadah kare hai zahid
why Priest, does bowl of wine displease

mai hai ye magas ki qai nahin hai
'tis wine, not excrement of bees

hasti hai na kuchh adam hai 'ghalib'
if being and nothingness are naught

akhir tu kya hai ai nahin hai
what is then tell me O is not
