my pain did not seek favors from any opiate
main na achchha hua bura na hua

I don't mind the fact that I did not recuperate
jama karte ho kyuun raqibon ko

you collect my enemies, why in this manner pray
ik tamasha hua gila na hua

a spectacle this is and not the way to remonstrate
ham kahan qismat azmane jaaen

even you refuse to test the sharpness of the blade
tu hi jab khanjar-azma na hua

say where else do I then go, now for to test my fate
kitne shirin hain tere lab ki raqib

how sweet are your honeyed lips, that even though my foe
galiyan kha ke be-maza na hua

was abused by you, is not, in an unhappy state
hai khabar garm un ke aane ki

the news of her arrival, I hear at such a time
aaj hi ghar men boriya na hua

when my home is to be found unfurnished, desolate
kya vo namrud ki khudai thi

what divinity was it that Nimrod once proclaimed
bandagi men mira bhala na hua

Worship was no use to me, it did not compensate
jaan di di hui usi ki thi

though I gave my life for Him, 'twas His in any case
haq to yuun hai ki haq ada na hua

to speak the truth I couldn't repay my dues to Him to date
zakhm gar dab gaya lahu na thama

if a wound is smothered then, blood's flow will not be stemmed
kaam gar ruk gaya rava na hua

if a task is stopped half-way, it does not consummate
rahzani hai ki dil-sitani hai

this is highway robbery this stealing of my heart
le ke dil dil-sitan ravana hua

takes my heart and flees forthwith she doen't even wait
kuchh to paá¸Œhiye ki log kahte hain

do render a recitation, people start to say
aaj 'ghalib' ghazal-sara na hua

why is Ghalib silent pray why does he not orate
