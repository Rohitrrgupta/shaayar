phir mujhe dida-e-tar yaad aaya
I remember my moistened eyes again

My heart's thirsty longing and my pain
dam liya tha na qayamat ne hanuz

Barely did doomsday cease to be
phir tira vaqt-e-safar yaad aaya

The time of your parting came to me
The innocence of my wishes, surprise

phir vo nairang-e-nazar yaad aaya
Again I think of fascinating eyes

Heart's longing, weariness the reason, find
naala karta tha jigar yaad aaya

I would have pled but patience came to mind
zindagi yuun bhi guzar hi jaati

Life would in any case pass by and by
kyuun tira rahguzar yaad aaya

Your street I now recall, tell me why
kya hi rizvan se laḌai hogi

Where is the courage now to plead at all
ghar tira khuld men gar yaad aaya

Sick of the heart my patience I recall
My thought now goes back to your lane

dil se tang aa ke jigar yaad aaya
My missing heart I think of now again

phir tire kuche ko jaata hai khayal
What kind of desolation there this be

Home comes to mind the desert when I see
koi virani si virani hai

What fight with heaven's doorman there will be
dasht ko dekh ke ghar yaad aaya

Whoughts of your house, if there, trouble me
main ne majnun pe laḌakpan men 'asad'

When in youth, on majnuun's head, a stone
sang uThaya tha ki sar yaad aaya

I heft to cast, I then recalled my own
vasl men hijr ka Dar yaad aaya

ain jannat men saqar yaad aaya
