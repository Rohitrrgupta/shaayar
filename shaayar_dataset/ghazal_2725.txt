dafn jab khaak men ham sokhta-saman honge
fils maahi ke gul-e-sham-e-shabistan honge

where the arrow glances of my dearest shall be shed
nim-bismil kai honge kai be-jan honge

many will lie partly-wounded, many will be dead
tab-e-nazzara nahin aaina kya dekhne duun

how can I let her see the mirror, she lacks strength to see
aur ban jaenge tasvir jo hairan honge

a picture she'll herself become, stunned by the imagery
tu kahan jaegi kuchh apna Thikana kar le

where will you go I worry, do find a place to stay
ham to kal khvab-e-adam men shab-e-hijran honge

O lonely night tomorrow, death will take me away
naseha dil men tu itna to samajh apne ki ham

in your heart O preacher you must know this is true
laakh nadan hue kya tujh se bhi nadan honge

extremely foolish I may be, but not as much as you
kar ke zakhmi mujhe nadim hon ye mumkin hi nahin

Impossible, that after wounding you she would repent
gar vo honge bhi to be-vaqt pasheman honge

it will be at the wrong time if she's ever penitent
ek ham hain ki hue aise pasheman ki bas

I am one who has been so ashamed in love, I dread
ek vo hain ki jinhen chaah ke arman honge

for them who harbour hope for paths of love to tread
ham nikalenge sun ai mauj-e-hava bal tera

O breeze I'll take the wind away from your sails I dare
us ki zulfon ke agar baal pareshan honge

if you perturb a single strand of my beloved's hair
sabr ya rab miri vahshat ka paá¸Œega ki nahin

chara-farma bhi kabhi qaidi-e-zindan honge
To the messiah Jesus, know, I will never plead

zindagi ke liye sharminda-e-ehsan honge
as for this favour, all my life, I'll be shamed indeed

tere dil-tafta ki turbat pe adu jhuTa hai
at your scorched-heart lover's grave, lies has my rival fed

gul na honge sharar-e-atash-e-sozan honge
flowers,he would not have placed, but fiery shoals instead

ghaur se dekhte hain tauf ko ahu-e-haram
kya kahen us ke sag-e-kucha ke qurban honge

dagh-e-dil niklenge turbat se miri juun laala
bursting forth like tulips from my grave will scars be found

ye vo akhgar nahin jo khaak men pinhan honge
these are not those sparks that will lay hidden in the ground

chaak parde se ye ghamze hain to ai parda-nashin
if through the opening in the veil such glances will be sent

ek main kya ki sabhi chak-e-gareban honge
then what to say of mine alone each collar will be rent

phir bahar aai vahi dasht-navardi hogi
now that spring again returns

phir vahi paanv vahi khar-e-mughilan honge
these feet of mine those thirsting thorns will once again address
