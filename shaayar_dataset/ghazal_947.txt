sarakti jaae hai rukh se naqab ahista ahista
the veil slips from her visage at such a gentle pace

nikalta aa raha hai aftab ahista ahista
as though the sun emerges from a cloud's embrace

javan hone lage jab vo to ham se kar liya parda
as she came of age she started to be veiled from me

haya yak-lakht aai aur shabab ahista ahista
shyness came to her at once, beauty then slowly

shab-e-furqat ka jaaga huun farishto ab to sone do
I haven't slept since parting eve, O Angels, I request

kabhi fursat men kar lena hisab ahista ahista
I'll settle your accounts at leisure for now let me rest

saval-e-vasl par un ko adu ka khauf hai itna
on question of our meeting, so scared of rival's she

dabe honTon se dete hain javab ahista ahista
in soft tones thus replies, her answer whisperedly

vo bedardi se sar kaTen 'amir' aur main kahun un se
I tell her when she slashes at my neck so cruelly

huzur ahista ahista janab ahista ahista
my dear, take it easy, sweetheart do it properly
