gesu-e-tabdar ko aur bhi tabdar kar
Your lustrous tresses my dear Lord further illuminate

hosh o khirad shikar kar qalb o nazar shikar kar
The power of my senses, heart and consciousness negate

ishq bhi ho hijab men husn bhi ho hijab men
Love too is now clandestine, and beauty too is veiled

ya to khud ashkar ho ya mujhe ashkar kar
You, either should reveal me or, should come in open state

tu hai muhit-e-be-karan main huun zara si aabju
You are a mighty ocean, I, a droplet of no size

ya mujhe ham-kanar kar ya mujhe be-kanar kar
Either make me, too, immense or then assimilate

main huun sadaf to tere haath mere guhar ki aabru
If I an oyster be, my pearl's dignity's with thee

main huun khazaf to tu mujhe gauhar-e-shahvar kar
A pearl of regal lustre, if a grain of sand, create

naghma-e-nau-bahar agar mere nasib men na ho
Turn this fleeting moment to a day of

us dam-e-nim-soz ko tairak-e-bahar kar
If melodies of spring are not ordained to be my fate

bagh-e-bahisht se mujhe hukm-e-safar diya tha kyuun
Why did you bid me leave from paradise for now

kar-e-jahan daraz hai ab mira intizar kar
My work is yet unfinished here so you wil have to wait

roz-e-hisab jab mira pesh ho daftar-e-amal
On the day of reckoning when, you behold my slate

aap bhi sharmsar ho mujh ko bhi sharmsar kar
You will shame me and yourself you will humiliate
