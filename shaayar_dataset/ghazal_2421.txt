aah ko chahiye ik umr asar hote tak
A prayer needs a lifetime, an answer to obtain

kaun jiita hai tiri zulf ke sar hote tak
who can live until the time that you decide to deign

snares are spread in every wave, and reptiles in each lure
dekhen kya guzre hai qatre pe guhar hote tak

see, till it turns into a pearl, what must a drop endure
ashiqi sabr-talab aur tamanna betab

Love has a need for patience, desires are a strain
dil ka kya rang karun khun-e-jigar hote tak

as long my ache persists, how shall my heart sustain
ta-qayamat shab-e-furqat men guzar jaegi umr

saat din ham pe bhi bhari hain sahar hote tak
ham ne maana ki taghaful na karoge lekin

Agreed, you won't ignore me, I know but then again
khaak ho jaenge ham tum ko khabar hote tak

Into dust will I be turned, your audience till I gain
partav-e-khur se hai shabnam ko fana ki taalim

The Sun's burning intensity is the dewdrop's bane
main bhi huun ek inayat ki nazar hote tak

So till I'm favoured with a glance, I too shall remain
yak nazar besh nahin fursat-e-hasti ghafil

O ignorant, less than a glance does life's leisure remain
garmi-e-bazm hai ik raqs-e-sharar hote tak

for the dancing of the spark will the warmth sustain
gham-e-hasti ka 'asad' kis se ho juz marg ilaaj

save death, Asad what else release from this life of pain
shama har rang men jalti hai sahar hote tak

a Lamp must burn in every hue till dawn is there again
