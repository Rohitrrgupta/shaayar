aa ki miri jaan ko qarar nahin hai
come for my life lacks patience and tranquility

doesnâ€™t have the strength to bear waiting's cruelty
dete hain jannat hayat-e-dahr ke badle

heaven is decreed in lieu, of a life on earth
compared to the hangover of wine there is dearth

girya nikale hai teri bazm se mujh ko
Tears cause my expulsion, from your company

haae ki rone pe ikhtiyar nahin hai
Shame! On weeping that I have no authority

ham se abas hai guman-e-ranjish-e-khatir
that 'gainst you I bear grudges, you suspect in vain

khaak men ushshaq ki ghubar nahin hai
know that lover's graves do not dust of doubt contain

with your heart you should absorb, beauty of meaning
save the flower no mirror is for the fact of spring

qatl ka mere kiya hai ahd to baare
you have promised to slay me, I am joyful, glad

vaae agar ahd ustuvar nahin hai
if your promise is infirm, 'twill be truly sad

tu ne qasam mai-kashi ki khaai hai 'ghalib'
Gaalib as you swear an oath by your drunkenness

teri qasam ka kuchh e'tibar nahin hai
Your oath's thus beyond belief, I have to confess
