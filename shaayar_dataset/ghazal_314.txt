kabhi neki bhi us ke ji men gar aa jaae hai mujh se
when at times her heart, for me, is filled with piety

jafaen kar ke apni yaad sharma jaae hai mujh se
she then feels mortified as she recalls her cruelty

khudaya jazba-e-dil ki magar tasir ulTi hai
the outcome of my yearning Lord! is opposite although

ki jitna khinchta huun aur khinchta jaae hai mujh se
the closer that I seek to draw, the further does she go

vo bad-khu aur meri dastan-e-ishq tulani
she is short-tempered, impatient, and lengthy is my tale

ibarat mukhtasar qasid bhi ghabra jaae hai mujh se
beseeching me to be brief, the messenger does quail

udhar vo bad-gumani hai idhar ye na-tavani hai
there she is, mistrustful; here I am, frail and weak

na puchha jaae hai us se na bola jaae hai mujh se
she will never care to ask; I will not dare to speak

sambhalne de mujhe ai na-ummidi kya qayamat hai
Let me now compose myself, Despair-I beg of thee

ki daman-e-khayal-e-yar chhuTa jaae hai mujh se
as fragments of my loved one's thoughts do escape from me

takalluf bartaraf nazzargi men bhi sahi lekin
though even as I gaze at her, formality aside,

vo dekha jaae kab ye zulm dekha jaae hai mujh se
the torment that she's looked upon, I just cannot abide

hue hain paanv hi pahle nabard-e-ishq men zakhmi
at the outset, in love's strife, my feet are wounded, see

na bhaga jaae hai mujh se na Thahra jaae hai mujh se
no longer can I stand and wait, and nor can I now flee

qayamat hai ki hove muddai ka ham-safar 'ghalib'
'tis doomsday, Gaalib, with my rival she chooses to fare

vo kafir jo khuda ko bhi na saunpa jaae hai mujh se
that Heretic, who I would not place even in God's care
