dost gham-khvari men meri sai farmavenge kya
What use would be my friends to me if sympathy they'd shown

zakhm ke bharte talak nakhun na baá¸Œh javenge kya
By the time these wounds do heal wont my nails have grown

be-niyazi had se guzri banda-parvar kab talak
All bounds, your callousness exceeds, do tell me until when

ham kahenge hal-e-dil aur aap farmavenge kya
My feelings I keep pouring out, your asking me what then

hazrat-e-naseh gar aaven diida o dil farsh-e-rah
If the preacher comes to me, I'll welcome him again

koi mujh ko ye to samjha do ki samjhavenge kya
But someone should explain to me what will he explain

aaj vaan tegh o kafan bandhe hue jaata huun main
I will go with sword and coffin to her place today

uzr mere qatl karne men vo ab lavenge kya
What excuse, will she now find, my killing to delay

gar kiya naseh ne ham ko qaid achchha yuun sahi
If my advisors tie me down tis well but do tell me

ye junun-e-ishq ke andaz chhuT javenge kya
From my love crazed actions ever will I be set free

khana-zad-e-zulf hain zanjir se bhagenge kyuun
Lin her curls, I am entwined, from chains why will I flee

hain giraftar-e-vafa zindan se ghabravenge kya
For as I am love's prisoner, prisons don't frighten me

hai ab is mamure men qaht-e-gham-e-ulfat 'asad'
In this city there's a famine of love's aches today

ham ne ye maana ki dilli men rahen khavenge kya
What will I survive on if in dilli I now stay
