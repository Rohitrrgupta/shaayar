ve suraten ilahi kis mulk bastiyan hain
in which country / O my Lord! do those faces reside

ab dekhne ko jin ke ankhen tarastiyan hain
to gaze upon whom, now my eyes, with yearning are beside

aaya tha kyuun adam men kya kar chala jahan men
why did you come to nothingness / in life what did you do

ye marg-o-zist tujh bin aapas men hanstiyan hain
life and death, among themselves / do now make fun of you

kyunkar na ho mushabbak shisha sa dil hamara
why should it not be splintered like glass my heart is prone

us shokh ki nigahen patthar men dhanstiyan hain
glances of that playful one / can penetrate e'en stone

barsat ka to mausam kab ka nikal gaya par
though the rainy season passed / away so long before

mizhgan ki ye ghaTaen ab tak barastiyan hain
the clouds upon these lashes / still continue to pour

lete hain chhin kar dil ashiq ka pal men dekho
the lover's heart she snatches / in just a moment, see

khuban ki ashiqon par kya pesh-dastiyan hain
how beauties do behave with / their lovers forcibly

is vaste ki hain ye vahshi nikal na javen
ankhon ko meri mizhgan Doron se kastiyan hain

qimat men un ke go ham do jag ko de chuke ab
though I've rendered both the worlds / as payment for them now

us yaar ki nigahen tis par bhi sastiyan hain
even then my loved one's eyes / a bargain are somehow

un ne kaha ye mujh se ab chhoḌ dukht-e-raz ko
she said to me from now on / from wine you should abstain!

piiri men ai divane ye kaun mastiyan hain
O frenzied one, in dotage / by drunkenness what gain

jab main kaha ye us se 'sauda' se apne mil ke
when I made a plea to her with 'sauda' you should join

is saal tu hai saaqi aur mai-parastiyan hain
as this year Saaqi you are there / and worshipping of wine”
