ishrat-e-qatra hai dariya men fana ho jaana
to be consumed by oceans is the droplet's ecstasy

dard ka had se guzarna hai dava ho jaana
when pain exceeds all bounds becomes, itself the remedy

tujh se qismat men miri surat-e-qufl-e-abjad
lock's shackle and body's akin, to meeting in our fate

tha likha baat ke bante hi juda ho jaana
as soon as everything aligns, we're bound to separate

dil hua kasmakash-e-chara-e-zehmat men tamam
the struggle to resolve its woes, my weakened heart unmade

miT gaya ghisne men is uqde ka va ho jaana
in trying to undo the knot, it got completely frayed

ab jafa se bhi hain mahrum ham allah allah
now even from torture deprived, Lord mercy on me pray

is qadar dushman-e-arbab-e-vafa ho jaana
her to become so hostile to her followers this way

zoaf se girya mubaddal ba-dam-e-sard hua
infirmity replaced my tears, with sighs full of despair

bavar aaya hamen paani ka hava ho jaana
Twas only then that I believed, water can turn to air

dil se miTna tiri angusht-e-hinai ka khayal
thoughts of your hennaed fingers to uproot from this mine heart

ho gaya gosht se nakhun ka juda ho jaana
has now become a torture like, nails from one's flesh to part

hai mujhe abr-e-bahari ka baras kar khulna
if fragrance of the flower's not, desirous of your lane

rote rote gham-e-furqat men fana ho jaana
why in the path of bounding breeze, like dust does it remain

gar nahin nikhat-e-gul ko tire kuche ki havas
as after springtime's shower is, the clearing of the sky

kyuun hai gard-e-rah-e-jaulan-e-saba ho jaana
so, after parting's copious tears, it is for me to die

bakhshe hai jalva-e-gul zauq-e-tamasha 'ghalib'
chashm ko chahiye har rang men va ho jaana

ta ki tujh par khule ejaz-e-hava-e-saiqal
dekh barsat men sabz aaine ka ho jaana
