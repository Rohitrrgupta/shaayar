husn ghamze ki kashakash se chhuTa mere baad
after me, beauty was spared the strain of coquetry

baare aram se hain ahl-e-jafa mere baad
in great comfort are these cruel damsels after me

mansab-e-sheftagi ke koi qabil na raha
of rank, deserving none remains amongst those lovelorn

grace and airs are all deposed, for now that I am gone
shama bujhti hai to us men se dhuan uThta hai

from a candle extinguished dark smoke is seen to rise
shoala-e-ishq siyah-posh hua mere baad

the flame of love was dressed in black after my demise
khuun hai dil khaak men ahval-e-butan par yaani

at the beauties' sorry plight, my heart, in earth, does bleed
un ke nakhun hue mohataj-e-hina mere baad

after I have gone, their nails, from henna favours need
dar-khur-e-arz nahin jauhar-e-bedad ko ja

for her cruelty's address there is no worthy place
nigah-e-naz hai surme se khafa mere baad

she, on my death, collyrium does from her eyes erase
hai junun ahl-e-junun ke liye aghosh-e-vidaa

lunacy now bids adieu to love-crazed all around,
chaak hota hai gareban se juda mere baad

after me the tear's no more, then in the collar found
the stupefying wine of love, does anyone desire

hai mukarrar lab-e-saqi pe sala mere baad
after me, repeatedly, she calls out to inquire

gham se marta huun ki itna nahin duniya men koi
I die of grief as in this world there isn't even one

ki kare taziyat-e-mehr-o-vafa mere baad
who will mourn for faith and friendship when my life in done

aae hai bekasi-e-ishq pe rona 'ghalib'
for this helplessness of love, now tears I do shed

kis ke ghar jaega sailab-e-bala mere baad
whose home will this flood inundate, after I am dead

thi nigah meri nihan-khana-e-dil ki naqqab
be-khatar jiite hain arbab-e-riya mere baad

tha main guldasta-e-ahbab ki bandish ki giyah
mutafarriq hue mere rufaqa mere baad
