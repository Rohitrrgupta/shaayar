shamshir-e-barhana maang ghazab balon ki mahak phir vaisi hi
is razor-sharp, hair's parting line, the fragrance of her curls divine

juuḌe ki gundhavaT qahr-e-khuda balon ki mahak phir vaisi hi
enrapturing, her coiffure's braid, scent of her tresses does pervade

ankhen hain kaTora si vo sitam gardan hai surahi-dar ghazab
eyes saucer-like her face bedeck, just like a flask her slender neck

aur usi men sharab-e-surkhi-e-pan rakhti hai jhalak phir vaisi hi
and glimpses of deep scarlet wine, in her throat one can divine

har baat men us ki garmi hai har naaz men us ke shokhi hai
there's warmth in everything she says, in all her airs there mischief plays

qamat hai qayamat chaal pari chalne men phaḌak phir vaisi hi
slender and tall with nymph like grace, a flutter in her every pace

gar rang bhabuka atish hai aur biini shola-e-sarkash hai
her hue is of a fire blazed / and nose, a flame's rebellion crazed

to bijli si kaunde hai pari aariz ki chamak phir vaisi hi
like lightning does that angel strike, the luster of her cheeks alike

nau-khez kuchen do ghuncha hain hai narm shikam ik khirman-e-gul
two budding flowers her breasts array, her midriff soft as silken hay

barik kamar jo shakh-e-gul rakhti hai lachak phir vaisi hi
her slender waist a flower's stem, it undulates and sows mayhem

hai naaf koi girdab-e-bala aur gol surin ranen hain safa
her navel's whorl-calamity / and round her rump, thighs velvety

hai saaq bilorin sham-e-ziya paanv ki kafak phir vaisi hi
her calves are crystal's brilliant flame, soles of her feet too are the same

mahram hai habab-e-ab-e-ravan suraj ki kiran hai us pe lipaT
her breasts in silken bustier, rays of the sun to her adhere

jaali ki kurti hai vo bala goTe ki dhanak phir vaisi hi
her lacy blouse does so ignite, shimmering with golden light

vo gaae to aafat laae hai har taal men leve jaan nikal
her dulcet tones cause storms to rise, her every tune is my demise

naach us ka uThae sau fitne ghungru ki jhanak phir vaisi hi
her dancing raises mutiny, bells on her feet a symphony

har baat pe ham se vo jo 'zafar' karta hai lagavaT muddat se
at every step she does restrain, 'zafar', long I've tried in vain

aur us ki chahat rakhte hain ham aaj talak phir vaisi hi
and to this very day I claim / my love for her is just the same
