bazicha-e-atfal hai duniya mire aage
just like a child's playground this world appears to me

hota hai shab-o-roz tamasha mire aage
every single night and day, this spectacle I see

ik khel hai aurang-e-sulaiman mire nazdik
the throne of mighty Solomon's a trifle merely

ik baat hai ejaz-e-masiha mire aage
the Messiah's miracle's just another thing to me

juz naam nahin surat-e-alam mujhe manzur
except in name the world exists, I do not agree

juz vahm nahin hasti-e-ashiya mire aage
and objects of this life cannot but a delusion be

hota hai nihan gard men sahra mire hote
deserts are interned in sand in my presence see

ghista hai jabin khaak pe dariya mire aage
rivers rub their foreheads in dust in front of me

mat puchh ki kya haal hai mera tire pichhe
ask not, in your absence, what my state is apt to be

tu dekh ki kya rang hai tera mire aage
you see your own condition when you're in front of me

sach kahte ho khud-bin o khud-ara huun na kyuun huun
'tis true I preen, why should I not, self indulgently

baiTha hai but-e-aina-sima mire aage
when the beauty, mirror-faced, sits in front of me

only then, my eloquence, will you chance to see
rakh de koi paimana-e-sahba mire aage

let first a cup of wine be placed there in front of me
nafrat ka guman guzre hai main rashk se guzra

I refrain from envy lest it's deemed antipathy
kyunkar kahun lo naam na un ka mire aage

how can I ask anyone don't speak of her to me
iman mujhe roke hai jo khinche hai mujhe kufr

faith restrains me while I am tugged at by heresy
kaaba mire pichhe hai kalisa mire aage

behind me stands the mosque, the church in front of me
ashiq huun pa mashuq-farebi hai mira kaam

Though a lover I seduce my loved ones craftily
majnun ko bura kahti hai laila mire aage

Laila speaks ill of Majnuun when in front of me
khush hote hain par vasl men yuun mar nahin jaate

although in union happy you don't die of ecstacy
aai shab-e-hijran ki tamanna mire aage

the wish for night of separation comes in front of me
hai maujzan ik qulzum-e-khun kaash yahi ho

if only did this ocean of blood rage relentlessly
aata hai abhi dekhiye kya kya mire aage

what else lies in store for me I have yet to see
go haath ko jumbish nahin ankhon men to dam hai

let the cup and flask of wine remain in front of me
rahne do abhi saghar-o-mina mire aage

though my hands are motionless, my eyes as yet can see
ham-pesha o ham-mashrab o hamraz hai mera

colleague, coimbiber and my confidante is he
'ghalib' ko bura kyuun kaho achchha mire aage

tell me why you criticize Ghalib in front of me
