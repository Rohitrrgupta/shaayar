dekh to dil ki jaan se uThta hai
see if it rises from the heart or from the soul it flows

ye dhuan sa kahan se uThta hai
does anybody know the source from where this smoke arose

gor kis diljale ki hai ye falak
the sky is the grave of which person burnt in love

shola ik subh yaan se uThta hai
a ball of fire every morn rises there above

khana-e-dil se zinhar na ja
without a reason, do not leave the quarters of the heart

koi aise makan se uThta hai
does anyone in such a way from his home depart

naala sar khinchta hai jab mera
when my feelings find their voice in these my plaintive cries

shor ik asman se uThta hai
a deafening uproar occurs and resonates the skies

laá¸Œti hai us ki chashm-e-shokh jahan
where'er her am'rous glance its mark darts out to find

ek ashob vaan se uThta hai
thereon a storm's unleashed,with chaos close behind

sudh le ghar ki bhi shola-e-avaz
be mindful too of your abode, you of the flaming voice

duud kuchh ashiyan se uThta hai
smoke is rising from your nest, take heed ere you rejoice

baiThne kaun de hai phir us ko
who then will let him sit again, at peace how will he be

jo tire astan se uThta hai
if someone rises and departs from your company

yuun uThe aah us gali se ham
in such a manner from her street I had to go, I grieve

jaise koi jahan se uThta hai
from this universe as though someone were to leave

ishq ik 'mir' bhari patthar hai
love is a real burden, Miir, it is a heavy stone

kab ye tujh na-tavan se uThta hai
how can it be lifted by a weak person alone
