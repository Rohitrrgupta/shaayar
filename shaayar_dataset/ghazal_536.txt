lagta nahin hai dil mira ujá¸Œe dayar men
my heart wanders ill at ease / in this ravaged reign

kis ki bani hai alam-e-na-paedar men
who has found fruition / in transient terrain

in hasraton se kah do kahin aur ja basen
tell these woeful wishes to / go elsewhere and remain

itni jagah kahan hai dil-e-dagh-dar men
this heart has little room as it / is scarred and full of pain

kanTon ko mat nikal chaman se o baghban
from throwing throns out of the vale, O gardener, abstain

ye bhi gulon ke saath pale hain bahar men
they too grew, along with flowers, during spring's domain

bulbul ko baghban se na sayyad se gila
neither to the groundsman nor / to hunter does complain

qismat men qaid likkhi thi fasl-e-bahar men
for songbird to be caged, in spring, did destiny ordain

kitna hai bad-nasib 'zafar' dafn ke liye
say how ill-starred is 'zafar', that he could not obtain

do gaz zamin bhi na mili ku-e-yar men
e'en two yards, to be interred, in his beloved's lane
