tumhari anjuman se uTh ke divane kahan jaate
departing from your company, where could your lovers go

jo vabasta hue tum se vo afsane kahan jaate
what would happen to those legends that around you grow

nikal kar dair-o-kaaba se agar milta na mai-khana
if on leaving temple,mosque no tavern were be found

to Thukrae hue insan khuda jaane kahan jaate
what refuge would outcasts find this only God would know

tumhari be-rukhi ne laaj rakh li bada-khane ki
your indifference has managed to preserve the tavern's name

tum ankhon se pila dete to paimane kahan jaate
had we feasted from your eyes, what then would wine bestow

chalo achchha hua kaam aa gai divangi apni
twas a good thing that my madness was to some avail

vagarna ham zamane bhar ko samjhane kahan jaate
else, for my state, what other reason could the world I show

'qatil' apna muqaddar gham se begana agar hota
had pain and misery been strangers to my life somehow

to phir apne parae ham se pahchane kahan jaate
how would then I know the difference between friend and foe
