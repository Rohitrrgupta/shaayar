your anger served to alienate
bas yahi tujh se yaar hona tha

Love, why are you in such a state
just waiting, evenings I did pass

why hopeful had to be alas
kyuun na hote aziiz ghair tumhen

why wouldn't rivals, you hold dear
meri qismat men khvar hona tha

shamed, I was destined to appear
mujh se jannat men vo sanam na mila

her, I, in heaven, did not meet
hashr aur ek baar hona tha

so let now judgement day repeat
gar na thi ai dil us ke ranj ki taab

khaak hota na main to kya karta
us ke dar ka ghubar hona tha

harza-gardi se ham zalil hue
charkh ka e'tibar hona tha

aur se ham-kanar hai dushman
aaj to ham-kanar hona tha

shikva-e-dahr par kaha tum ko
kya mira ikhtiyar hona tha

sabr kar sabr ho chuka jo kuchh
has happened all that had to be

now patience, restless heart, merely
ku-e-dushman men ja pakaá¸Œta kyuun

kya mujhe sharmsar hona tha
vo namak-pash bhi nahin hote

yuun hi dil ko figar hona tha
khaak men haif ye sharab mile

by spilling thus wine is abused
the censor too should have caroused
