arz-e-niyaz-e-ishq ke qabil nahin raha
Incapable of voicing lovelorn longing as before

jis dil pe naaz tha mujhe vo dil nahin raha
No longer is my heart the same that did me proud of yore

jaata huun dagh-e-hasrat-e-hasti liye hue
I leave bearing the scars of life's desires unfulfilled

huun sham-e-kushta dar-khur-e-mahfil nahin raha
I am a candle extinguished and from the room dispelled

marne ki ai dil aur hi tadbir kar ki main
Find yet another way to die O heart

For worthy of the killer's hand no longer I remain
In all the six directions, doors of mirror God conjures

The fiction of faulty and flawless no longer obscures
va kar diye hain shauq ne band-e-naqab-e-husn

My passion caused her veil to drop her face can now be seen
ghair-az-nigah ab koi haail nahin raha

But for my vision there exists now nothing in between
In tyranny of livelihood athough enmeshed I'd be

lekin tire khayal se ghafil nahin raha
But every moment even then your thought remained with me

dil se hava-e-kisht-e-vafa miT gai ki vaan
Gone from this heart the wish for faithfulness to be instilled

hasil sivae hasrat-e-hasil nahin raha
For nothing grew from it except desires unfulfilled

bedad-e-ishq se nahin Darta magar 'asad'
I wouldn't have been frightened of love's injustices but for

jis dil pe naaz tha mujhe vo dil nahin raha
No longer is my heart the same that did me proud of yore

har-chand main huun tuti-e-shirin-sukhan vale
aina aah mere muqabil nahin raha

jan-dad-gan ka hausla fursat-gudaz hai
huun qatra-zan ba-vadi-e-hasrat shabana roz

juz tar-e-ashk jada-e-manzil nahin raha
ai aah meri khatir-e-vabasta ke siva

duniya men koi uqda-e-mushkil nahin raha
andaz-e-nala yaad hain sab mujh ko par 'asad'

jis dil pe naaz tha mujhe vo dil nahin raha
