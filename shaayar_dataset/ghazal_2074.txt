mohabbat tark ki main ne gareban si liya main ne
love I have renounced and sewn the collar that was ripped

zamane ab to khush ho zahr ye bhi pi liya main ne
O world now you be happy for this poison I have sipped

abhi zinda huun lekin sochta rahta huun khalvat men
though I am alive, I often think, when there is no throng

ki ab tak kis tamanna ke sahare ji liya main ne
based on what desire, tell me, have I lived this long

unhen apna nahin sakta magar itna bhi kya kam hai
though I cannot possess her, it's of major consequence

ki kuchh muddat hasin khvabon men kho kar ji liya main ne
that for a while, her in my dreams, I did experience

bas ab to daman-e-dil chhoá¸Œ do bekar ummido
the vestment of my heart O helpless hopes now leave alone

bahut dukh sah liye main ne bahut din ji liya main ne
I've lived far too long and sorrows ample have I borne
