kya kahun tum se main ki kya hai ishq
what can I say of love to thee

jaan ka rog hai bala hai ishq
ishq hi ishq hai jahan dekho

saare aalam men bhar raha hai ishq
Love fills this world entirely

ishq hai tarz o taur ishq ke taiin
love is the mode and style of love

kahin banda kahin khuda hai ishq
it's man below and God above

ishq maashuq ishq ashiq hai
both lover and beloved be

yaani apna hi mubtala hai ishq
gar parastish khuda ki sabit ki

if God's worship's true you say
kisu surat men ho bhala hai ishq

then love is good in every way
dilkash aisa kahan hai dushman-e-jan

so charming beautiful is she
muddai hai pa muddaa hai ishq

that love I seek, tho foe she be
hai hamare bhi taur ka ashiq

is there a paramour like me
jis kisi ko kahin hua hai ishq

koi khvahan nahin mohabbat ka
Love an improper thing you deem

tu kahe jins-e-na-rava hai ishq
for love does no one ever dream

'mir'-ji zard hote jaate ho
kya kahin tum ne bhi kiya hai ishq

by love, have you been smitten too
