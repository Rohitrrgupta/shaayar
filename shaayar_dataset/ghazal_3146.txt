ejaz-e-jan-dahi hai hamare kalam ko
life-bestowing miracles my poetry can claim

zinda kiya hai ham ne masiha ke naam ko
glory I have now restored to the Messiah's name

likkho salam ghair ke khat men ghulam ko
in his rival's message greetings to your slave you pen

bande ka bas salam hai aise salam ko
your slave can only salute such a salutation then

ab shor hai misal jo di us khiram ko
a hue ensues then when I use your gait as similie

yuun kaun janta tha qayamat ke naam ko
of doomsday, say, how else aware could anybody be

aata hai bahr-e-qatl vo daur ai hujum-e-yas
she comes to slay me at a time, when miseries surround

ghabra na jaae dekh kahin azhdaham ko
I hope she is not daunted by this mob that’s all around

go aap ne javab bura hi diya vale
though you may have replied to him as rudely as you claim

mujh se bayan na kiije adu ke payam ko
don't tell me what was in my rival's message, just the same

yaan vasl hai talafi-e-hijran men ai falak
here, Heavens, union's recompense for parting's torment

kyuun sochta hai taaza sitam intiqam ko
then for revenge, new tortures, why do you invent

tere samand-e-naz ki beja shararten
karte hain aag nala-e-andesha-kam ko

girye pe mere zinda-dilo hanste kya ho aah
rota huun apne main dil-e-jannat-maqam ko

sah sah ke na-durust tiri khu bigaḌ di
Iniquity I endured, and spoilt your temperament

ham ne kharab aap kiya apne kaam ko
I thereby managed to defeat what was my own intent

us se jala ke ghair ko ummid-e-pukhtagi
lag jaae aag dil ke khayalat-e-kham ko

bakht-e-saped aina-dari kare to main
dikhlaun dil ke jaur us aina-fam ko

jab tu chale janaza-e-ashiq ke saath saath
if you were to walk side by side with your lover's hearse

phir kaun varison ke sune izn-e-am ko
who would pay attention to the heir's leave to disperse

shayad ki din phire hain kisi tira-roz ke
maybe in his dark days someone's

ab ghair us gali men nahin phirte shaam ko
no longer, evening time, do rivals in her street traverse

muddat se naam sunte the 'momin' ka baare aaj
for ages we have heard the name of momin, finally

dekha bhi ham ne us shoara ke imaam ko
the leader of all poets now we too have got to see
