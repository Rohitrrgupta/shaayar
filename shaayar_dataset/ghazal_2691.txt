hasti apni habab ki si hai
my life is like a bubble now

ye numaish sarab ki si hai
nazuki us ke lab ki kya kahiye

the softness of her lips is close
pankhuá¸Œi ik gulab ki si hai

to velvet petals of a rose
chashm-e-dil khol is bhi aalam par

do let your heart's eye see this world
yaan ki auqat khvab ki si hai

tis but a dreamlike state unfurled
baar baar us ke dar pe jaata huun

halat ab iztirab ki si hai
I go, lo, such is my distress

your brow inscribed upon your skin
bait ik intikhab ki si hai

a line of poetry akin
main jo bola kaha ki ye avaz

when I spoke out, she did complain
usi khana-kharab ki si hai

that derelict is here again
atish-e-gham men dil bhuna shayad

this heart long burnt in sorrow's hell
der se bu kabab ki si hai

there is a barbecue like smell
dekhiye abr ki tarah ab ke

just as a monsoon cloud appears
meri chashm-e-pur-ab ki si hai

these eyes of mine are full of tears
'mir' un nim-baz ankhon men

miir in her half-ope eyes there is
saari masti sharab ki si hai

the fullness of wine's heady bliss
