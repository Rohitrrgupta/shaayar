main aur bazm-e-mai se yuun tishna-kam aauun
thirsty from gathering of wine would I leave this way

gar main ne ki thi tauba saaqi ko kya hua tha
if I had vowed to abstain where was the saaqii pray

hai ek tiir jis men donon chhide paḌe hain
both of these lie pierced now, with merely one dart

vo din gae ki apna dil se jigar juda tha
those days are past when my heart and liver were apart

darmandagi men 'ghalib' kuchh ban paḌe to janun
achievement would be if in sorrow's desperation be

jab rishta be-girah tha nakhun girah-kusha tha
when threads possessed no knots, my nails, possessed facility
